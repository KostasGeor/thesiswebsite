I start off with a PDF file and my goal is to turn this into a JSON object. I used a third party library to turn the PDF file into XML, and now I am trying to parse the XML into JSON. However, I could also just parse the PDF straight into a POJO or JSON without going through the XML step if that would be easier, but I believe that parsing from XML is easier..I have a complex XML (or PDF) representing research papers, with multiple sections each identified by a title unknown beforehand. This title could be anything. I know what some of the titles are, such as ""Abstract"" and ""Introduction"". These would be easy for me to parse. as we have specific sections for these in our JSON schema. However, we also have a ""full_text"" section that contains the text from the rest of the document. Each paragraph in the ""full_text"" will also have a ""section"" identifier, which shows what section the paragraph belongs to (such as ""Conclusion"" or ""Results"" or ""Discussion""). The very specific need that I have is that each section in the PDF or the XML can have multiple nested subsections. But I do not care for these nested subsection titles -- I only care for the text inside them, as any paragraphs inside the subsections will belong to the top-most section containing them..In summary, once I find a section, say, Results, I need to get all the text within it and within its subsections and then move on to the next section on the same level as Results. The name of the sections and subsections are unknown to me beforehand, but their names will go into a simple String field called ""section."".Edit: Looking at the complexity of the xml files, I now believe parsing straight from PDF might even be better.",question-summary-61094201,Error compiling for board NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module) exit status 1, json  xml  parsing  xml-parsing  pdf-parsing ,2020-04-08 06:01:45Z,43,0

Also, thank you for providing this code (Python: Elegant way to check if at least one regex in list matches a string).This is the code I am most worried about. It runs the regular expression, and returns what it finds to a string. The ""set"" is to remove duplicates.This line runs the code and picks up the text by row.

This is a request for a default explanation of the simplest case and how to fix it. Typical error:.I can access the URL through browsers (Firefox, Chrome) and get HTML which represents what I want, but cannot access this programmatically..I have read several accounts of how to fix this (e.g. [2]), but they generally refer to ""your Keystore"" or ""trust manager"" as if everyone knows what these are. I am concerned that if I don't know what I am doing, I could break security. I don't know how I add sites to these or whether I even should..I am on MACOSX and appear to have a binary file.Some of the answers suggest I should have a file called ""truststore.jks"" but don't say where this should be or how it was created..So I am asking for a simple explanation of the system components and the simplest way to fix it. In some cases, I can avoid it (e.g., by using curl from the command-line), so I don't know how much this is a Java (8) problem..EDIT: Trust Store vs Key Store - creating with keytool seems to explain the difference between KeyStore and TrustStore, but I still don't have insight into what to do..[1] http://machinepublishers.github.io/jBrowserDriver/com/machinepublishers/jbrowserdriver /JBrowserDriver.html [2] Using a custom truststore in java as well as the default one",question-summary-60259973,How do I implement a timer on each question asked in a quiz?, java  macos  x509certificate  pkix ,2020-02-17 10:02:47Z,177,6

This is CSV data with 5 columns (date, county, state, FIPS (a 5 character geographic identifier which sometimes has leading 0's and also has some NULLs), cases and deaths). The problem is that cases and deaths are cumulative. The problem was to try to reorganized the data by date, state, and county, then determine the number of new cases and new deaths each day. The first thought was to do this by a Cursor, which took forever. A crafty contributor here had suggested self-joining the import table with an added RowID, and off-setting the RowID by 1 in a WHERE clause, hence:.The next job was doing a conditional subtraction of the previous day's cases / deaths from the current day's. There were three cases to deal with 1. The first row of the join where the previous day was NULL - this needed the first row values are those of the current day. 2. When the previous day's row was from a different state and/or county, the current day's values are those of the current day (like 1 above). 3. Where the state and county were the same as the previous day, a simple subtraction was performed.In SQL-Server syntax, the whole statement is:.This executed quickly (1 sec?) on SQL-Server with 80,000 rows.I rewrote this for MySQL as:.Unfortunately, this kept throwing an error immediately before.Eventually, I rewrote this without the FROM as.This actually worked and executed in 4.4 seconds.It appears the results are now the same for both SQL-Server and MySQL.

As part of this process, I'm re-coding heatmap values from continuous to ordinal format - so I have a heatmap where six colours represent specific count categories, and those categories are created from aggregated count values. However, this causes a major performance issue with the speed of the creation of heatmap using ggplotly(). I've traced it to the tooltip() function from Plotly which renders interactive boxes. Labels data from my heatmap somehow overload this function in a way that it performs very slowly, even if I just add a single label component to the tooltip(). I'm using a processed subset of COVID-19 outbreak data from Johns Hopkins CSSE repository. Here is a simplified heatmap code, which also uses The Simpsons colour theme from ggsci:.Performance improves once tooltip = c(""text"",""label"",""label2"") is reduced (for instance to tooltip = c(""text"")). Now, I know that delay is not ""massive"", but I'm integrating this with a Shiny app. And once it's integrated with Shiny and scaled with more data, it is really, really, really slow. I don't even show all variables in tooltip and its still slow - you can see it in the current version of the app when you click on 'confirmed' cases..Any suggestions?

They live in their own GitHub repositories and are served using GitHub Pages. Right now each of these repositories has a copy of all the files except the ones that are part of the theme. Somewhat inconveniently, I have no previous experience with Jekyll, Ruby or GitHub Pages..I know there are multilingual jekyll tricks, but that is not what I am here for, mostly because I want sites on different domains..So I decided that it might be good to hijack the theme as a store for files common to my sites. So I made a test copy of my site without the common files. It uses as ""remote_theme"" a copy of the theme where I stuck my common files in the theme's assets directory, so they get pulled in by the different language sites. This works for images, PDF files and such: I just move them to /assets/images in the theme and it all works..However, next to data files local to each language, such as the menu below our site title, I also have some common data files, such as the list of languages that the site is available in and the list of volunteers we thank for their work. I'd like to also place these in the theme somehow so I don't have to commit them to all the repos separately... Cannot get this to work..What I have tried:.Adding _data to the regexp in the .gemspec file of the theme where it reads: f.match(%r{^((_includes|_layouts|_sass|assets)/|(LICENSE|README)((\.(txt|md|markdown)|$)))}i).Does not lead to the data files being accessible.Creating dummy _data files that {% include the real ones from the theme's _include dir..""found character that cannot start any token while scanning for the next token"".Set data_dir in _config.yml to assets/data.I can use the data files that are site specific just fine, but the data files on the theme side are not seen by the Liquid processing. (They are copied to the _site directory along with the site-specific ones.).Is there a way to have a GitHub Pages site with some data coming from its own files and some data coming from the theme files? I realise I'd probably have to rebuild the site to make the theme changes show. (Right?) (Is there a way to trigger a rebuild on GitHub Pages other than to change files? What does the version number on the theme do?).Is there a more in-depth writeup of how the files from the theme and the site get mixed and what order things happen in than the jekyll user documentation?.Please by all means also tell me if there's a much better, simpler and/or more elegant way to do what I am trying to accomplish.

Basically I have a script that reads daily COVID-19 case numbers and produces maps where the counties are color-coded by the percent of the population infected. The script produces five maps, a national one and one for each of the four official census regions: northeast, midwest, south and west. To cut down on size, the below is just the national and widwest maps..My original script actually produces animated gifs showing the spread of the disease, but they take a long time to render. The below version just gives a single plot of the most recent data and should run pretty quickly..I've used a dput in the below script to avoid you having to read a file and geocode locations (I commented out the code) but there is still a large csv file of county populations that has to be read in. I have posted it at pastebin here..This is the national map I got this morning when I ran the code..Note that there is a scale for the number of personnel at the bases (the colored diamonds) but there is no scale for the shading of the counties..Here is the midwest map. You can see from the code that it is the same ggplot just with a dataset that is filtered down to the counties in the midwest region...Now the scale is there. As mentioned in my previous question I thought that the answer had been something to do with the width of the image being insufficient to accommodate the scale. When I added a newline in the legend text to shorten it that appeared to do the trick. But now the legend is disappearing again, andmaking the output image wider has no effect. Plus, just by eyeball it would appear there is plenty of room in the national plot to accommodate the scale..Another bizarre aspect is the behavior associated with rounding the breaks. Below is a west map where I applied no rounding to the breaks..So the scale is back but it goes to 6 decimal places. If I try to round it to 2.I get this map..which surely indicates the horizontal space isn't the issue...if it can accommodate 6 decimal places then surely there's room for 2?.I've spent as much time trying to figure out this inconsistent scale behavior as I spent writing the original script.

However, only clicking on the submit button does refresh the page without changing the bar chart at all.

While I probably should start a blog about the book's subject (the crisis triggered by the coronavirus), this would not be the place to keep records of subjects like how to make bookdown work with a non-standard directory structure. Also, blogdown wants its own project directory, which sort of breaks the connection to the original project. (The blog and research project subdirectories do share a common parent, but this seems awfully kludgy.).So I came back to the idea of including this diary in the original bookdown project. But I know no other way to do this than with an Rmd file, which (I think) cannot automatically insert accurate date-time stamps in individual posts, use tags, etc. Since I'm so new to some of this stuff, I'm writing here to ask those of you with more experience, ""What's the best way to meet this common need?""

The only things I've changed are adding data for the four large Canadian provinces to the data from the 14 European countries for which the model is built, and extending the forecast to 30 days into the future (the default is 7, but the code is designed to allow this kind of extension)..The core function of the model is to estimate expected daily death tolls based on country fixed effects and the interventions that are in place to slow down the virus. It also produces expected death tolls under a counterfactual scenario where no interventions are ever used (e.g. the only thing that affects death tolls is the predicted total infections and the infection fatality rate), in the generated quantities block of the stan code..Every time I run it, though, I get warnings like these:.E_deaths0 refers to expected deaths given no mitigation interventions on day 128, the last day of the forecast, in region 18 (June 2 in Quebec, in this case)..the code for generating these estimates is.Where prediction0[i, m] is the estimated infections on day i in country m, N2 being the total number of days to estimate (128). ifr_noise[m] is a modifier for the infection fatality rate in country m, and f_rev[m] is a vector of probabilities of dying on each day after being infected. There's no reason any of the elements that go into calculating E_deaths0 would ever be NA, and while prediction0 is estimated at 0 in a lot of samples for late dates and the later values of f_rev[m] round to 0, that doesn't seem like it should cause a problem because no division is happening..This happens for different geographies each time. The dates also vary, although it's always the last n days of the simulation in a given region, with n between 1 and 8 or so. I assume the problem is in sub_col(prediction0, 1, m, i-1), because f_rev[m] is data, so there's no potential for sampling issues, and if ifr_noise[m] were taking NA values then all dates for geography m would fail. I don't see how, though, because prediction0 is generated immediately before E_deaths0 and never causes warnings..When I extract predictions of E_deaths0[128,18] or whichever estimates have problems in that run from the model fit, there are as many samples as I'd expect and they're all in a plausible range. I'm not sure whether I can trust those results, though, when the process to generate them throws random warnings..Anybody have experience with issues like this, or any ideas?

This doesn't happen with all files, just 80-100 (no rhyme or reason as to which ones). I can't figure how these changes seem to be ""leaking"" from one branch to another while I'm simply making changes to a single PDF..OR.B) Gitkraken shows dozens of new files that are numerated duplicates of existing files (""file.html"" is duplicated, and a new file is showing in the repo branch called ""file 2.html"") Again here, this isn't all files, only a couple dozen (sometimes more)..In either case I end up abandoning the branch and creating a new one from the last time I saw Hotfix behaving as expected..It's been doing the latter (B) for a while now, but since it was only really a nuisance (I can delete a few duplicate files) I've been mostly ignoring it..However, the ""leaking"" changes has the potential to be crippling and to destroy my hotfix branch, and my ability to go back cleanly to the normal ops version when this stuff all ends. I keep dreading looking at the repo and seeing a hundred or more file changes in there I didn't make. This ""leaking"" has only started happening this morning, far as I can tell, but I've already had to abandon two new branches. If I end up doing this again, it will meet the definition of insanity..Now I just ducked back into Gitkraken after a system restart, (with Dreamweaver still closed so I can take it out of the equation) and now my COVID branch is showing the same behavior in reverse! 98 Changes from Hotfix are now showing in COVID branch..I'm beside myself.

It's a PyTorch implementation of COVID-Net. I use a training set to train on, validation set to save the best performing model, and then a test set to measure the ""real"" performance of the model. However, I noticed that my model ""learned"" to classify normal/pneumonia really good, but it just ignored the underpopulated COVID set. Therefore I choose to undersample (reduce the number of training instances of the other classes (normal and pneumonia) in order to get equal populations). This worked well, but my sample set has been reduced to ~1500 samples (low!). The results are somewhat worse than COVID-Net, I achieve an accuracy of ~80% and lower sensitivity on underpopulated classes (COVID) then they report. I suppose that they report better performance because they do not use a validation-set and use the test-set each epoch. I figured that they might indirectly overfit on the test-set because of that. I have chosen to explain this so that the reader gets a context..Question.I tried adding privacy to the training procedure by using Differential Privacy. Specifically, I used Facebook's PyTorch-DP module. Training works just as well if I choose to add almost no-privacy (this can be achieved by choosing a really low noise multiplier value (sigma), i.e. 1e-7) and a really high delta. So it's not that the module itself is not working/faulty, but, if I use a lower sigma (so I add more noise) then I get more privacy (epsilon decreases) but the model fails to fit the data at all. The question is: how do I manage to add privacy to a somewhat meaningful degree while making sure that my model somewhat fits the data still?.Performance differences.Confusion Matrix of Model without Differential Privacy added. It's not ""good"" but it's at least somewhat meaningful and the model reaches an accuracy of ~80%..Confusion Matrix of Model with Differential Privacy (epsilon: 2.3) after 100 epochs. It looks as if the model does not know what to do, at all..Possible explanations.I read a paper that stated that adding Differential Privacy can cause bad performance in the sense that the accuracy decreases for underpopulated classes. But, I used undersampling and I think this should've solved that, but the accuracy stays bad (for all classes!)..Maybe because my sample set is so small, differential privacy is much harder to achieve, and therefore the performance is bad? However, even if add a really tiny bit of privacy, with an epsilon value >20000, the model still struggles in learning how to classify.

For example; I want to find and tag telephone numbers. +1 234-567-8901 before my tags get run, Standford tags ""+1"" as ""NUMBER"" and ""234-567-8901"" also as ""NUMBER"" however, they remain as separate tags. I have tried creating my own TokensRegex rule to find these and mark them as ""TELEPHONE_NUMBER"". They are successfully changed to the new tag, but they remain separate tags..I have also noticed that this happens when tagging text and digits. Say if I wanted to tag ""my number is 234-567-8901"" then it would tag ""my number is"" as one tag and ""234-567-8901"" as a separate tag. I have tried using the B-TELEPHONE_NUMBER and I-TELEPHONE_NUMBER tags as mention in the documentation and it does remove the B and I, but they remain separate tags. I have noticed this behavior only happens with Stanford's tags. I have tested it with DATE and it does the same thing.So, my question is, how can I get Stanford's tags to merge with mine? If they can't be merged, is there a way to delete that tag and then add my own tag?.EDIT.here is another example of the tags not merging together..This snippet is suppose to catch covid 19.However, 19 is tagged as a NUMBER before this rule is run. it tags covid as CORONAVIRUS and changes 19's tag from NUMBER to CORONAVIRUS. It's suppose to then combine the two into one entity mention, but it doesn't. When it comes across corona virus, which is also separated into two tokens, it combines the two into one entity mention..EDIT 2.I decided to make a small pipeline to replicate the issue. I based it off the example found here https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/tokensregex.html I made modification to more closely replicate the one used in our pipeline. here is the function.Here is the output.As you can see the tags like COMPANY are merged into one mention when next to each other.

Thought I'd start here, since it's primarily a question about a specific error, which happens to be in a machine learning algorithm, rather than a question about approaches or methods..I'm working on a machine learning project to forecast the number of deaths by US county from COVID on Kaggle. To tune the hyperparameters of the random forest regressor, I'm using sklearn's RandomizedSearchCV class, but fitting it throws a IndexError: positional indexers are out-of-bounds, though the traceback only references the pandas module. This does not happen when normally fitting the random forest regressor without the RandomizedSearchCV and using a simpler splitting method (no cross validation)..At first I thought it might be to do with the range of values that I passed to it, but I reduced the values for each parameter and all parameters, but get the same problem..My current suspicion is that it's in the custom cross validation class that I'm using to do a split on multiple time series (MultipleTimeSeriesSplit in the code), but it seems to work on the training data just fine. It doesn't work on the labels alone, since the splitting depends on the fips_target column in the features. Im not confident that this is the current issue either, since attempting to split the labels results in a missing column error, not a positional index error..What is causing this IndexError? How can I get it functioning?.The following code is for Kaggle, but if you're not on it, you should be able to download the necessary data set here..This minimal example does not include the functional fitting of the random forest regressor without cross validation, nor the other models that I'm testing out, nor the demographic data that I joined to the covid data..The existing answer does not address my error.

Each file is 267 rows and goes out to column EH with a new column added daily. I have a macro for each file. The Confirmed file takes about a minute - minute and a half to run. And when done it looks like this.....I don't import any of the confirmed = 0 data points. I've added the population/pop density columns to delete all the countries I don't care about (those with population = 0). This file has about 6800 rows and of course, this will also grow daily. When the Confirmed file is imported, of course the next thing is Deaths. When I try to import the Deaths file excel goes to 'Not Responding' state and doesn't finish. I've waited on the Deaths macro for about an hour before I killed it and it's still not done. I can see that the correct numbers are being put into the correct column in my consolidated file but it really shouldn't take so long or lock up excel like this. I realize that three For Loops is going through a lot of cells a lot of times. Is there a better way to do this?.Here is the Deaths import code:.If more code is needed, I'll provide.",question-summary-62452645,Data Structure to efficiently merge data for CSV Writing, excel  vba  for-loop ,2020-06-18 14:43:07Z,37,0

Using the resulting JSON, I plan on using the pandas library to create a dataframe that stores a bunch of sequence meta-data from the BiologicalAsset objects, along with columns for the actual sequence, its length, and its sequenceType fields, which come from the Sequence object. This data is printed and is then moved to R for further viewing of the results. However, I am having trouble getting the data that I want from C3.ai and I am not sure why..In the code below, I specify that I am including the Biological Asset as well as the sequence child object, the length, and the sequence type. This is all working correctly because I am receiving a dataframe with all of the correct columns after I flatten the JSON with json_normalize(). I use the ""filter"": ""sequence.length >= 28900"", to filter out any sequences that are too short to be a complete genome. The problem is that I am only getting 105 results the fit this criteria and I know this is false because the NCBI Coronavirus data hub has almost 3000 sequences that it flags as complete. Futhermore, filtering for nucleotide sequences that have valid sequences in the child object using ""filter"": ""assetType == 'nucleotide sequence' && exists(sequence.sequence)"", yields the same result. Using ""filter"": ""exists(sequence.sequence)"", shows that there are only 1314 sequences of any type, including protein sequences, that actually have data in their child sequence object. Running these same searches using the sequence fetch API ""https://api.c3.ai/covid/api/1/sequence/fetch"" and the appropriate length and existence filters has given me the same numbers..Browsing a table I made using an sequence fetch I made to retrieve all possible sequences by using no filter, I found that the sequence objects themselves existed for probably all of the sequences I need, but that the actual sequence fields themselves are missing.

I keep them separate so their colors aren't skewed..When they're put together in a subplot, the yaxis label on the right is the first row label on the left..I would like to remove that yaxis label, and have tried by means of fig.update_yaxes(title=''/None/False), also the title_text argument, I've also tried accessing it via fig['layout']['scenes']['yaxis2']['title'] = ''/None/False. Seems like a lot of resources (including official documentation) show how to change a single figure, as could be demonstrated with my code via.which unfortunately doesn't carry over when fig2 is added to the subplot. I'm not sure how this assignment is happening. I've reviewed the JSON structure and see no assignment, I've also dug through the structure in their documentation to see if there was something I could override or set. Can someone help me figure out how to hide the fig2 yaxis label? Might be more accurate to ask how one would set this manually, but nonetheless..*edit* I've taken a closer look at the annotations. The figures annotations are set with this bit.these are based on.which are just 2d arrays of integers. checking the annotations in each figure for 'A', the Figure they're added to as subplots is the only one that contains the 'A'.based on that, this could easily be ""solved"" retroactively by overwriting the annotation like so.this works, but feels very finicky and I would still like to know how this is supposed to be done with plotly. This approach feels like it could have unintended effects depending on application..Upon closer inspection I'm also realizing there are no annotations placed on the first 2 columns of the bottom row despite them having annotations in their original figure.I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing or if it's my approach that's incorrect in setting annotations.I'll leave it as is because this post is becoming cumbersome, but there's a problem: 1) with the annotations and 2) the y title for fig2; I feel like they have to be related though I don't know how this is occurring.I've separated my code below, a Paste is available here..imports.data prep.plot_prep.creating and joining the figures",question-summary-62665912,"When I use jupyter notebook to pip install COVID19Py ,I get a ERROR Command errored out with exit status 1", python  plotly ,2020-06-30 20:47:39Z,182,5

I would like to perform basic math against the values within a given field so that I can get a daily tally..JHU publishes their data daily, so let's assume that the numbers reported reflect a 24-hour period..Example: In the State of New York, I can see the following values for Last_Update and Recovered, where Recovered is a rolling sum of all cases where people have recovered from infection:.Ideally, I would like to create a new field (be it a scripted field, or a new field that is generated via a Logstash Filter processor) called RecoveredToday, where the field value reflects the difference between today's Recovered aggregation and yesterday's Recovered aggregation..In the above data set, RecoveredToday is calculated from the value of Recovered on 2020-08-05 minus the value of Recovered on 2020-08-04..With respect to using a Scripted Field in Kibana, according to this blog article, Scripted Fields can only analyze fields within one given document at a time, and cannot perform calculations against a field across multiple documents..I do see user @agung-darmanto solved a similar problem on StackOverflow, but the solution calls out specific dates rather than performing rolling calculations. It's also unclear from the code snippet if the results are being inserted into a new field that can subsequently be used to build visualizations..The approach to use Logstash ruby processing on the fly also presents a problem. Logstash, as far as I know, cannot access an already ingested document ... and if it can, it's probably a pretty ugly superpower to wield..Goal: There are other fields provided in the JHU CSSE data which are also pre-aggregated.

The second graph is again a linechart, this time with a single y-axis. For the sake of internal consistency, also this graph is built using base R plot() commands..In order to combine the two graphs, I am saving them as two separate objects, using recordPlot(), which I store for combining them in a single column graph using plot_grid() with the parameter ``ncol = 1''.

I have been using Covid-19 data from the NYTimes (NY Times Covid Data on Github) as a test data set for learning about statistical programming..From their Github repository, you can get the case data for the US as a whole, by state, or by county. Whichever one you are looking at, there is a cumulative total for the number of known cases and the number of deaths for each location and each date. A location doesn't show up in the data set until there is at least one case or death, and then once there it gets updated every day in perpetuity..My goal is to come up with a way to do calculations for new cases since yesterday, new cases since last week, etc and add these calculations as new columns to my dataframe. I have found a strategy that works with smaller sets of data but gets pretty slow when dealing with nationwide data at the county level..I will generate some random data to use as an example..So first I tried to reverse engineer the cumulative sum. I have not been able to successfully produce what I want..And I needed more flexibility than just figuring out the daily new cases anyway. A lot of the epidemiology models are based on comparing the known cases or deaths today to the known cases or deaths a week ago, or ten days ago, or three weeks ago, or whatever..I built some for loops that worked okay, but the code was clunky and error-prone. And so I came up with this strategy using sapply with the sum function, bracket sub-setting, and binary relational operators. Coming from Excel world, this is basically an approximation of SUMIFS..This works great and I can do all kinds of calculations playing off of this theme. New cases per day, new cases per week, per month. I can calculate a proxy for known active cases by taking the difference between the known cases today and the known cases from n days ago. Subtract the deaths from that and you have a good proxy for known recovered cases in a given area. Substitute the sum function for mean and you can do all kinds of rolling averages. Add some population data and you do it all on a per capita basis. And the subsetting is really powerful for looking at a particular region or metropolitan area or for comparing different locations based on demographic/mobility variables from other data sets. So I am mostly pretty happy with my progress, especially at the national and state levels..However, when you start getting down to the county level it gets pretty slow as the datasets get pretty huge. Did you know there are 254 counties in Texas alone? And a lot of times the daily updates revise past numbers. Obviously, I can just schedule it to run over night or split the data up into smaller chunks, etc. But I'm interested mostly just to understand the mechanics of wrangling huge time series datasets efficiently..So TLDR; is there a computationally faster method to do these calculations in a dataset with millions of rows?.And as secondary questions, people often mention data.table for very large datasets, would this be a good application for that package and what would the syntax look like? I haven't figured out how to do it without relying on the same sapply trick and then it's probably not any faster. Or are there time-series packages for R that do this kind of thing well already whose code I could examine for pointers?.Thank you.If it matters, I'm running RStudio 4.0.2 on Windows10.

However, I'm concerned that fitting a logistic regression model would 'train' and overfitt the model to my data (slope would be 1 and intercept 0). A second way of doing that would be going after the original paper where they validated the score and getting their predicted death rates by each level of score. However, I dont think people would actually do that..Here goes the code..To make things easier for understanding, my problem is validating the PSI (Pneumonia Severity Assessment) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients.

I seem to be experiencing the same problem as the poor soul in this thread: https://forums.iis.net/t/1240175.aspx..NOTE: I posted this earlier today on Superuser - I realized there is a large base of IIS-tagged questions on SO so thought I'd also post here..OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit 2004 19041.508.Problem: Basically, IIS will not serve static content over a certain arbitrary size - static files over that size will just timeout eventually. Non-static content, for example asp files do not have this limit and load as expected regardless of size. This started happening seemingly out of nowhere with no directly related IIS/system/network/permission changes..Things I've Tried:.Details:.About a 1 or 1.5 months ago my local IIS stopped working, out of the blue. By out of the blue I mean the the previous day it was working fine as always and the next it stopped - without having done any system changes whatsoever. By stopped working I mean (eventually realized) that it was only static files that were not serving correctly. Unfortunately/fortunately, I noticed the problem because I had created the obligatory personal COVID tracker. It was html/js running against a .NET API back end. The pages stopped loading and I spent time wondering what I had borked in the code (which I also hadn't touched). Eventually I realized no static content - images, css, js, html, txt etc. - was loading properly. I ran some tests and I found that there was a cutoff point in size of content that would load, but it is somewhat arbitrary. For example, the iisstart.png image in the default IIS website does not load - it's 97K. I replaced it with an 8k file that loads fine. I could get about 1500 bytes served in an html file - 1501 bytes would send it off the rails but 1500 worked. Same sort of thing was found for text files although I was able to send more than 1500 bytes - don't remember how much but did find a point where a 1 byte difference caused a problem..Test Load of Default IIS Website:.IIS log is not helpful - it reports the failed attempt as a 200 but says it took 19 seconds. It is returning a win32 status code of 121 though:.The tracing mostly doesn't fire I guess because the 200 is eventually returned?.Fiddler gives me this for the image request:.For this site the actual html loads fine - it's only 696 bytes - the image it references does not though (97K)..If anybody can shed some light on this or give me a direction in troubleshooting I would greatly appreciate it..Thanks",question-summary-64504331,How can I de-normalize a dataset which was normalized using an unknown scaling factor?, iis  iis-10  static-content ,2020-10-23 17:00:28Z,23,0

And when rendering my gaming videos I managed to achieve up to 3x better compression with the same quality. However there is this one video that when rendered with the same parameters the file size increases..The EE1.mkv should be recorded with CBR 15000KB bit rate, with superfast preset and high profile.

All referenced files can be found on my Github at this address..I am running a Python simple script on a free EC2 instance on AWS, which is supposed to fill a form (it is actually the french covid attestation forms) and download it with some data taken from a JSON file (in the config folder)..This project was more of a pretext to use a distant VM and see how it would work out. I have installed all necessary tools as on my host machine in the VM, especially Python 3.8, Selenium, ChromeDriver and Google Chrome (the configuration file is called scripts/configure.sh)..The main (and only script) src/main.py works well on my local machine, as it fills the form and downloads it in a specific folder. But it seems that on the VM, the download does not happen..The options I have put so far for my webdriver are :.I also have set all directories to chmod 777 in case it is a permission problem, as I saw it could be a common thing.
I have no errors, which mean it succeeds to perform all form fillings (I was first thinking about a the final form not being complete). I also tried to locate the downloaded file somewhere, but it is nowhere to be found.
Finally, I also tried it interactively with a terminal console locally, and it also works fine..It worked at some point ! First only at once, and then all the times with embedded arguments instead of JSON files. So to use it on my phone and share it with friends, I just added the fact that my python script takes the information to fill as an input :.So it could be that python WebElement.sendKeys(...) works differently now ? I have tried to back up but could not make it work again, it has to come from the VM config somehow but I also tried to reboot the VM or to create a new one and it still did not work..So if any of you ran into the same problem and found a magical solution for this problem, I'd be happy to know !",question-summary-64732483,Impossible to download with Selenium/Chrome (Python) on an EC2 instance, python  selenium  google-chrome  amazon-ec2  selenium-chromedriver ,2020-11-07 21:13:19Z,Viewed 23 times,0

Some of them have me talking for 30+ min. while recording my screen as I demonstrate something. So I end up with dozens and dozens of .mp4 video files. I've recently been asked to create a transcript of each video that can be used as a ""closed caption"" to satisfy the ADA (American Disabilities Act) for the hearing impaired. I looked into pretty much every commercially available transcription solution to see about having all these videos transcribed. I've also looked into all seven of the open-source or free solutions like Google's Cloud Speech, IBM Watson's speech recognition... etc. and to quickly get to the point... all the commercially available solutions (DeScript, Audiate) all carry a fee (naturally). The company I work for has been hit by COVID pretty hard, so we are on total lockdown for new purchases and licenses. All the free and open source services only allow really small files that my 30 min. long videos dwarf. So I set out to see about creating a solution using Python. I found the SpeechRecognition package... and that lead me to find Carnegie Mellon's Pocketsphinx open source speech recognition toolkit. I was elated when I was able to get it all working, and I ran my first Transcription, and it worked!!! I did have to convert the .mp4 to a .wav file for it to work. And... the transcription isn't really all that great. If you think Siri's ""talk to text"" service makes mistakes... the transcript that resulted from my .WAV transcription was very... in the ballpark... but not perfect by any means. But, hey... I'll take it. It is a whole lot easier to scan and fix a .txt transcript than it is to sit and literally dictate it by hand..My question is... the transcripts that result from the Pocketsphinx solution have no capitalization, punctuation, or any sense of grammer. They are just a flat-out .txt file with a bunch of words that I have to go back and add punctuation too..Can any of you maybe point me in the direction of some way to either improve the transcription, or reprocess the resulting .txt file to insert some basic punctuation?

The inconsistencies are an issue because we are trying to hone our query to a certain error rate (error rate being how many URLs provide effective research information).

2535,48.5908946,"Baden-Württemberg, Deutschland",9.0399498,https://stackoverflow.com/users/14729199/kryptolix,"Good morning :).I have some questions regarding an icecast-setup. We have my own (Nextcloud)-Server sitting in our church. This works perfectly fine and since here in Germany the community services got forbidden already once during all this Covid19-stuff, we want to have a stream-setup. I managed to set up an icecast-instance on our server and we use my old laptop with Rocket Broadcaster and a Steinberg CI2 to provide the source for the stream. That works all as intended. We already used it once because we stopped public services for two weeks after one of our member got tested positive after he went abroad for a week. Our operator on the PA doesn't want to have another display there, which would disturb him from listening the sermon..My project regarding this: I have a RPi4 and a Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD. The input atm is a standard mic, that is connected to the Interface. The Pi is configured with darkice and uses its own icecast installation, while I am testing everything at home. Since I started the streaming project, after the service we switched Rocket Broadcaster to use VLC and a folder of old service recordings (mastered and in MP3-format) to provide a source to listen while we are at work or on travels. This option gets used pretty regularly and I want to keep it going. My plan is to have a little box with a LED levelmeter, where the input level is shown. That should be done with a little python script. Also I want to add two buttons, where presets for the two setups get loaded. Button 1: kill the current source and start the darkice livestream. Button 2: kill the current source and start the playback of old recordings. Both options should have visual feedback for the operator. The raspberry has to work in headless mode without need for a VNC or SSH-connection for the normal usage..My problem: I tried: sudo killall darkice && /home/pi/darkice.sh.This code will get changed, because I probably have to use ices for the mp3-playback. So basically it kills darkice, starts the ices playback (for now only restarts the stream in a blink) and vice versa. The bash-file exists and gets executed at reboot via cronjob. That works well. When I execute the above mentioned killall command, icecast continues the broadcast almost instantly, but the stream stops on the clients. Everyone needs to restart it. Do I have an option to change the setup, so that I am able to switch between the two options without the need for everyone to restart? My plan was to create a bash-script, where I do this all inside and execute it via GPIO-input and pythoncode..Thanks in advance!",question-summary-65060199,Icecast stream switching sources without the clients stopping playback, python  icecast  raspberry-pi4 ,2020-11-29 12:43:25Z,Viewed 36 times,1

There are several endpoints that are accessed via a class enum per context of the request from the container view.
The data accumulates in a Singleton class amongst other endpoints for quicker access via member views..One member view is displayed per endpoint..Goal: to notify the parent View after the requested endpoint has returned data for display; which in turn populates a particular member view...Problem: Needless to say, the member view is always rendered before receiving the data.
That is, it's out-of-sync..In fact, the only way to have the data seen is via a button on the container view to display the member view with the data on demand. This is NOT what I want. I want this to happen automatically upon data-source selection..My Solution: to fire off a Notification to the container view once data is available so the container view can render the appropriate member view with the data..Problem: I'm using the publisher-subscribe scenario to wait for notification so I can display the data.
But I'm confused at handling the subscriber within the container view..I was thinking of using the **NSNotification** use of a handler @Objc function vs publish/subscribe.
But I'm mixing imperative with the subjective paradigm here..The following piece of code posts the notification upon receiving data:.The following code snippet is within a function of a View to handle the Notification.
This isn't firing..Question: should I pass a publisher variable between the class & the container view from which to launch the subscriber?.I understand the cause/affect of using @State <--> @Binding in synchronous time.

I am using RStudio for Mac v1.3.1093, and R v4.0.3..This chart, which uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to estimate infections and the level of spread, first obtains data showing new cases by day in the American state of Oklahoma. This is very quick in both the Console and R Markdown. The next part is the MCMC modelling, which is where the delays are coming..I ran it this morning and it took 2.5 hours in R Markdown, compared to 30 minutes when running the query as an R Script in the Console..I can't work out why it's SO much slower in the R Markdown version. This becomes more important because, if I run the query at a county level (say, for 10 counties), then it models this 10 times, and would therefore take 10 times longer..As a shortcut, I can simply run 2 queries, with the output of the modelling query being added into a bigger R Markdown query (e.g., by saving/reading in an RDS file).
