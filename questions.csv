I have a question about improving the efficiency of regular expression search in a pandas DataFrame..I've organised the dataset so I have dataframe with a title, abstract and the full text of the article in each row. The goal is to search the full text for keywords using a regular expression, and then return a set in a new column. As a first step, I am searching for the virus mentioned in each article. I am also using a dataset from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses to help me identify the virus (https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/master-species-lists/m/msl/8266).While I understand that my dataset is large, and there is a lot of data in the ""Full text"" column (400,000+ lines, and 100s of words in the full text column) , my current script run has ran for 2 days non-stop. I would like to check whether if there is a way to improve it's efficiency, as I want to run other regular expression searches, and preferably not have to wait for so long..I've created a mock dataset, but with the script I am using. Is there anyway for me to improve it's efficiency?.Mock dataset.This is from the ICTV website, I downloaded the spreadsheet from the website, to replicate, please download the spreadsheet, and change the folder path.Organising the data.I've melted the dataset into a single column. Articles may mention the same virus in different conjucations (coronavirus, coronaviridae, coronavirale etc. I want to capture all versions).From my understanding, all virus names will have the stem ""vir"" in it's name, it can be at the beginning, the middle or in the end..These lines attempt to capture prefix fof the virus using a regular expressions.This converts the list returned from the regular expression to a string..This step takes all the virus in panda's series and puts it into a single string. Also, thank you for providing this code (Python: Elegant way to check if at least one regex in list matches a string).This is the code I am most worried about.

As part of this process, I'm re-coding heatmap values from continuous to ordinal format - so I have a heatmap where six colours represent specific count categories, and those categories are created from aggregated count values. However, this causes a major performance issue with the speed of the creation of heatmap using ggplotly(). I've traced it to the tooltip() function from Plotly which renders interactive boxes. Labels data from my heatmap somehow overload this function in a way that it performs very slowly, even if I just add a single label component to the tooltip(). I'm using a processed subset of COVID-19 outbreak data from Johns Hopkins CSSE repository. Here is a simplified heatmap code, which also uses The Simpsons colour theme from ggsci:.Performance improves once tooltip = c(""text"",""label"",""label2"") is reduced (for instance to tooltip = c(""text"")). Now, I know that delay is not ""massive"", but I'm integrating this with a Shiny app. And once it's integrated with Shiny and scaled with more data, it is really, really, really slow. I don't even show all variables in tooltip and its still slow - you can see it in the current version of the app when you click on 'confirmed' cases..Any suggestions?

They live in their own GitHub repositories and are served using GitHub Pages. Right now each of these repositories has a copy of all the files except the ones that are part of the theme. Somewhat inconveniently, I have no previous experience with Jekyll, Ruby or GitHub Pages..I know there are multilingual jekyll tricks, but that is not what I am here for, mostly because I want sites on different domains..So I decided that it might be good to hijack the theme as a store for files common to my sites. So I made a test copy of my site without the common files. It uses as ""remote_theme"" a copy of the theme where I stuck my common files in the theme's assets directory, so they get pulled in by the different language sites. This works for images, PDF files and such: I just move them to /assets/images in the theme and it all works..However, next to data files local to each language, such as the menu below our site title, I also have some common data files, such as the list of languages that the site is available in and the list of volunteers we thank for their work. I'd like to also place these in the theme somehow so I don't have to commit them to all the repos separately... Cannot get this to work..What I have tried:.Adding _data to the regexp in the .gemspec file of the theme where it reads: f.match(%r{^((_includes|_layouts|_sass|assets)/|(LICENSE|README)((\.(txt|md|markdown)|$)))}i).Does not lead to the data files being accessible.Creating dummy _data files that {% include the real ones from the theme's _include dir..""found character that cannot start any token while scanning for the next token"".Set data_dir in _config.yml to assets/data.I can use the data files that are site specific just fine, but the data files on the theme side are not seen by the Liquid processing. (They are copied to the _site directory along with the site-specific ones.).Is there a way to have a GitHub Pages site with some data coming from its own files and some data coming from the theme files? I realise I'd probably have to rebuild the site to make the theme changes show. (Right?) (Is there a way to trigger a rebuild on GitHub Pages other than to change files? What does the version number on the theme do?).Is there a more in-depth writeup of how the files from the theme and the site get mixed and what order things happen in than the jekyll user documentation?.Please by all means also tell me if there's a much better, simpler and/or more elegant way to do what I am trying to accomplish.

Basically I have a script that reads daily COVID-19 case numbers and produces maps where the counties are color-coded by the percent of the population infected. The script produces five maps, a national one and one for each of the four official census regions: northeast, midwest, south and west. To cut down on size, the below is just the national and widwest maps..My original script actually produces animated gifs showing the spread of the disease, but they take a long time to render. The below version just gives a single plot of the most recent data and should run pretty quickly..I've used a dput in the below script to avoid you having to read a file and geocode locations (I commented out the code) but there is still a large csv file of county populations that has to be read in. I have posted it at pastebin here..This is the national map I got this morning when I ran the code..Note that there is a scale for the number of personnel at the bases (the colored diamonds) but there is no scale for the shading of the counties..Here is the midwest map. You can see from the code that it is the same ggplot just with a dataset that is filtered down to the counties in the midwest region...Now the scale is there. As mentioned in my previous question I thought that the answer had been something to do with the width of the image being insufficient to accommodate the scale. When I added a newline in the legend text to shorten it that appeared to do the trick. But now the legend is disappearing again, andmaking the output image wider has no effect. Plus, just by eyeball it would appear there is plenty of room in the national plot to accommodate the scale..Another bizarre aspect is the behavior associated with rounding the breaks. Below is a west map where I applied no rounding to the breaks..So the scale is back but it goes to 6 decimal places. If I try to round it to 2.I get this map..which surely indicates the horizontal space isn't the issue...if it can accommodate 6 decimal places then surely there's room for 2?.I've spent as much time trying to figure out this inconsistent scale behavior as I spent writing the original script.

I'm finding I need to keep several different kinds of notes: on the research itself, on my R coding, on how to use certain tools, on my configurations, etc..Initially, I just want to keep a diary focused on the background technology: how I configured the RStudio project itself, what packages I installed, why I started to use Packrat but then deleted the project and started over, that bookdown needs certain yaml fields in its index.Rmd file to work properly (took me a day to find this out), and so on. I figured I can't be the first person to have a need for record-keeping like this..So I started by looking for an R package, an RStudio addin, or a R Markdown template or literate programming that could insert dated entries, maybe handle tags, etc. Having no luck, I started to learn about the blogdown package..Soon I decided this is overkill. While I probably should start a blog about the book's subject (the crisis triggered by the coronavirus), this would not be the place to keep records of subjects like how to make bookdown work with a non-standard directory structure.

The only things I've changed are adding data for the four large Canadian provinces to the data from the 14 European countries for which the model is built, and extending the forecast to 30 days into the future (the default is 7, but the code is designed to allow this kind of extension)..The core function of the model is to estimate expected daily death tolls based on country fixed effects and the interventions that are in place to slow down the virus. It also produces expected death tolls under a counterfactual scenario where no interventions are ever used (e.g. the only thing that affects death tolls is the predicted total infections and the infection fatality rate), in the generated quantities block of the stan code..Every time I run it, though, I get warnings like these:.E_deaths0 refers to expected deaths given no mitigation interventions on day 128, the last day of the forecast, in region 18 (June 2 in Quebec, in this case)..the code for generating these estimates is.Where prediction0[i, m] is the estimated infections on day i in country m, N2 being the total number of days to estimate (128). ifr_noise[m] is a modifier for the infection fatality rate in country m, and f_rev[m] is a vector of probabilities of dying on each day after being infected. There's no reason any of the elements that go into calculating E_deaths0 would ever be NA, and while prediction0 is estimated at 0 in a lot of samples for late dates and the later values of f_rev[m] round to 0, that doesn't seem like it should cause a problem because no division is happening..This happens for different geographies each time. The dates also vary, although it's always the last n days of the simulation in a given region, with n between 1 and 8 or so. I assume the problem is in sub_col(prediction0, 1, m, i-1), because f_rev[m] is data, so there's no potential for sampling issues, and if ifr_noise[m] were taking NA values then all dates for geography m would fail. I don't see how, though, because prediction0 is generated immediately before E_deaths0 and never causes warnings..When I extract predictions of E_deaths0[128,18] or whichever estimates have problems in that run from the model fit, there are as many samples as I'd expect and they're all in a plausible range.

I tried loading as many tweets I needed by scrolling to the bottom of the page, scrolled back up to the start of the page and then fetched the required elements.

The three datasets are cases, deaths and recover. Things are going ok but I have a slight problem and need some advice. The graphs are updated with a new column each day and this causes me some problems when I try write code to show the daily increase in numbers from today over yesterday. Currently I have to manually update my code each day to compensate for the extra columns in the 3 csv files as my code reads like:-.So the last line has to be copied, pasted and then updated each day.

This doesn't happen with all files, just 80-100 (no rhyme or reason as to which ones). I can't figure how these changes seem to be ""leaking"" from one branch to another while I'm simply making changes to a single PDF..OR.B) Gitkraken shows dozens of new files that are numerated duplicates of existing files (""file.html"" is duplicated, and a new file is showing in the repo branch called ""file 2.html"") Again here, this isn't all files, only a couple dozen (sometimes more)..In either case I end up abandoning the branch and creating a new one from the last time I saw Hotfix behaving as expected..It's been doing the latter (B) for a while now, but since it was only really a nuisance (I can delete a few duplicate files) I've been mostly ignoring it..However, the ""leaking"" changes has the potential to be crippling and to destroy my hotfix branch, and my ability to go back cleanly to the normal ops version when this stuff all ends. I keep dreading looking at the repo and seeing a hundred or more file changes in there I didn't make.

It's a PyTorch implementation of COVID-Net. I use a training set to train on, validation set to save the best performing model, and then a test set to measure the ""real"" performance of the model. However, I noticed that my model ""learned"" to classify normal/pneumonia really good, but it just ignored the underpopulated COVID set. Therefore I choose to undersample (reduce the number of training instances of the other classes (normal and pneumonia) in order to get equal populations). This worked well, but my sample set has been reduced to ~1500 samples (low!). The results are somewhat worse than COVID-Net, I achieve an accuracy of ~80% and lower sensitivity on underpopulated classes (COVID) then they report. I suppose that they report better performance because they do not use a validation-set and use the test-set each epoch. I figured that they might indirectly overfit on the test-set because of that. I have chosen to explain this so that the reader gets a context..Question.I tried adding privacy to the training procedure by using Differential Privacy. Specifically, I used Facebook's PyTorch-DP module. Training works just as well if I choose to add almost no-privacy (this can be achieved by choosing a really low noise multiplier value (sigma), i.e. 1e-7) and a really high delta. So it's not that the module itself is not working/faulty, but, if I use a lower sigma (so I add more noise) then I get more privacy (epsilon decreases) but the model fails to fit the data at all. The question is: how do I manage to add privacy to a somewhat meaningful degree while making sure that my model somewhat fits the data still?.Performance differences.Confusion Matrix of Model without Differential Privacy added. It's not ""good"" but it's at least somewhat meaningful and the model reaches an accuracy of ~80%..Confusion Matrix of Model with Differential Privacy (epsilon: 2.3) after 100 epochs. It looks as if the model does not know what to do, at all..Possible explanations.I read a paper that stated that adding Differential Privacy can cause bad performance in the sense that the accuracy decreases for underpopulated classes. But, I used undersampling and I think this should've solved that, but the accuracy stays bad (for all classes!)..Maybe because my sample set is so small, differential privacy is much harder to achieve, and therefore the performance is bad? However, even if add a really tiny bit of privacy, with an epsilon value >20000, the model still struggles in learning how to classify.

I have tried creating my own TokensRegex rule to find these and mark them as ""TELEPHONE_NUMBER"". They are successfully changed to the new tag, but they remain separate tags..I have also noticed that this happens when tagging text and digits. Say if I wanted to tag ""my number is 234-567-8901"" then it would tag ""my number is"" as one tag and ""234-567-8901"" as a separate tag.

Thought I'd start here, since it's primarily a question about a specific error, which happens to be in a machine learning algorithm, rather than a question about approaches or methods..I'm working on a machine learning project to forecast the number of deaths by US county from COVID on Kaggle. To tune the hyperparameters of the random forest regressor, I'm using sklearn's RandomizedSearchCV class, but fitting it throws a IndexError: positional indexers are out-of-bounds, though the traceback only references the pandas module. This does not happen when normally fitting the random forest regressor without the RandomizedSearchCV and using a simpler splitting method (no cross validation)..At first I thought it might be to do with the range of values that I passed to it, but I reduced the values for each parameter and all parameters, but get the same problem..My current suspicion is that it's in the custom cross validation class that I'm using to do a split on multiple time series (MultipleTimeSeriesSplit in the code), but it seems to work on the training data just fine. It doesn't work on the labels alone, since the splitting depends on the fips_target column in the features. Im not confident that this is the current issue either, since attempting to split the labels results in a missing column error, not a positional index error..What is causing this IndexError? How can I get it functioning?.The following code is for Kaggle, but if you're not on it, you should be able to download the necessary data set here..This minimal example does not include the functional fitting of the random forest regressor without cross validation, nor the other models that I'm testing out, nor the demographic data that I joined to the covid data..The existing answer does not address my error.

The figures annotations are set with this bit.these are based on.which are just 2d arrays of integers. checking the annotations in each figure for 'A', the Figure they're added to as subplots is the only one that contains the 'A'.based on that, this could easily be ""solved"" retroactively by overwriting the annotation like so.this works, but feels very finicky and I would still like to know how this is supposed to be done with plotly. This approach feels like it could have unintended effects depending on application..Upon closer inspection I'm also realizing there are no annotations placed on the first 2 columns of the bottom row despite them having annotations in their original figure.I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing or if it's my approach that's incorrect in setting annotations.I'll leave it as is because this post is becoming cumbersome, but there's a problem: 1) with the annotations and 2) the y title for fig2; I feel like they have to be related though I don't know how this is occurring.I've separated my code below, a Paste is available here..imports.data prep.plot_prep.creating and joining the figures",question-summary-62665912,"Suppress y axis label in plotly subplot, annotation misalignment", python  plotly ,2020-06-30 20:47:39Z,Viewed 507 times,5

Some of the metrics they publish in their daily US reports are sum aggregations. I would like to perform basic math against the values within a given field so that I can get a daily tally..JHU publishes their data daily, so let's assume that the numbers reported reflect a 24-hour period..Example: In the State of New York, I can see the following values for Last_Update and Recovered, where Recovered is a rolling sum of all cases where people have recovered from infection:.Ideally, I would like to create a new field (be it a scripted field, or a new field that is generated via a Logstash Filter processor) called RecoveredToday, where the field value reflects the difference between today's Recovered aggregation and yesterday's Recovered aggregation..In the above data set, RecoveredToday is calculated from the value of Recovered on 2020-08-05 minus the value of Recovered on 2020-08-04..With respect to using a Scripted Field in Kibana, according to this blog article, Scripted Fields can only analyze fields within one given document at a time, and cannot perform calculations against a field across multiple documents..I do see user @agung-darmanto solved a similar problem on StackOverflow, but the solution calls out specific dates rather than performing rolling calculations. It's also unclear from the code snippet if the results are being inserted into a new field that can subsequently be used to build visualizations..The approach to use Logstash ruby processing on the fly also presents a problem. Logstash, as far as I know, cannot access an already ingested document ... and if it can, it's probably a pretty ugly superpower to wield..Goal: There are other fields provided in the JHU CSSE data which are also pre-aggregated.

The second graph is again a linechart, this time with a single y-axis. For the sake of internal consistency, also this graph is built using base R plot() commands..In order to combine the two graphs, I am saving them as two separate objects, using recordPlot(), which I store for combining them in a single column graph using plot_grid() with the parameter ``ncol = 1''.

And I ended up running these files by importing them in a certain order(Don't know If that was the best way). So here is where I ran into an error. I don't exactly know if this error is because of how I imported my files or my tkinter code is just wrong. I just couldn't seem to click on a button twice. I would run my program and click on a button, it would run properly and then the next time I clicked on that same button It would just not work. There was no error and no output. Nothing would happen. Here is my code:.So my question and problem is: Why can I not click on a button more than twice? This has happened to me before and I could not fix it.

I have been using Covid-19 data from the NYTimes (NY Times Covid Data on Github) as a test data set for learning about statistical programming..From their Github repository, you can get the case data for the US as a whole, by state, or by county. Whichever one you are looking at, there is a cumulative total for the number of known cases and the number of deaths for each location and each date. A location doesn't show up in the data set until there is at least one case or death, and then once there it gets updated every day in perpetuity..My goal is to come up with a way to do calculations for new cases since yesterday, new cases since last week, etc and add these calculations as new columns to my dataframe. I have found a strategy that works with smaller sets of data but gets pretty slow when dealing with nationwide data at the county level..I will generate some random data to use as an example..So first I tried to reverse engineer the cumulative sum. I have not been able to successfully produce what I want..And I needed more flexibility than just figuring out the daily new cases anyway. A lot of the epidemiology models are based on comparing the known cases or deaths today to the known cases or deaths a week ago, or ten days ago, or three weeks ago, or whatever..I built some for loops that worked okay, but the code was clunky and error-prone. And so I came up with this strategy using sapply with the sum function, bracket sub-setting, and binary relational operators. Coming from Excel world, this is basically an approximation of SUMIFS..This works great and I can do all kinds of calculations playing off of this theme. New cases per day, new cases per week, per month. I can calculate a proxy for known active cases by taking the difference between the known cases today and the known cases from n days ago. Subtract the deaths from that and you have a good proxy for known recovered cases in a given area. Substitute the sum function for mean and you can do all kinds of rolling averages. Add some population data and you do it all on a per capita basis. And the subsetting is really powerful for looking at a particular region or metropolitan area or for comparing different locations based on demographic/mobility variables from other data sets. So I am mostly pretty happy with my progress, especially at the national and state levels..However, when you start getting down to the county level it gets pretty slow as the datasets get pretty huge. Did you know there are 254 counties in Texas alone? And a lot of times the daily updates revise past numbers. Obviously, I can just schedule it to run over night or split the data up into smaller chunks, etc. But I'm interested mostly just to understand the mechanics of wrangling huge time series datasets efficiently..So TLDR; is there a computationally faster method to do these calculations in a dataset with millions of rows?.And as secondary questions, people often mention data.table for very large datasets, would this be a good application for that package and what would the syntax look like? I haven't figured out how to do it without relying on the same sapply trick and then it's probably not any faster. Or are there time-series packages for R that do this kind of thing well already whose code I could examine for pointers?.Thank you.If it matters, I'm running RStudio 4.0.2 on Windows10. And I do most of my wrangling with base R and dplyr.",question-summary-63908900,Looking for a faster way to compute conditioned reverse cumulative sums of large time series in R, r  dplyr  time-series  data.table  large-data ,2020-09-15 19:48:04Z,Viewed 91 times,0

My project regards validation of Community Acquired Pneumonia Scores in a Retrospective Cohort, however, for this question, I will create a simulated data-set..Suppose I have 3 predictor variables (hemoglobin, creatinine and sex) which are continuous, continuous and binary respectively and the outcome is death which is also binary outcome..And suppose there is a model out there that says that points for hemoglobin, creatinine and sex to predict death. It assigns 1 point if male, 2 points if hemoglobin less or equal to 12 and 3 points if creatinine greater or equal to 1. I then calculate the respective score in R and will have the outcome in numbers from 0 to 6 maximum. I have the also the outcome of those patients, however, I have a scale in points and not probabilities. How can I test the calibration of this model?.The simplest way that comes to my mind is fitting it a logistic model (eg. glm(data = outcome, death ~ score)) and then using for example the function calibrate from rms package to plot it. However, I'm concerned that fitting a logistic regression model would 'train' and overfitt the model to my data (slope would be 1 and intercept 0). A second way of doing that would be going after the original paper where they validated the score and getting their predicted death rates by each level of score.

I seem to be experiencing the same problem as the poor soul in this thread: https://forums.iis.net/t/1240175.aspx..NOTE: I posted this earlier today on Superuser - I realized there is a large base of IIS-tagged questions on SO so thought I'd also post here..OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit 2004 19041.508.Problem: Basically, IIS will not serve static content over a certain arbitrary size - static files over that size will just timeout eventually. Non-static content, for example asp files do not have this limit and load as expected regardless of size. This started happening seemingly out of nowhere with no directly related IIS/system/network/permission changes..Things I've Tried:.Details:.About a 1 or 1.5 months ago my local IIS stopped working, out of the blue. By out of the blue I mean the the previous day it was working fine as always and the next it stopped - without having done any system changes whatsoever. By stopped working I mean (eventually realized) that it was only static files that were not serving correctly. Unfortunately/fortunately, I noticed the problem because I had created the obligatory personal COVID tracker. It was html/js running against a .NET API back end. The pages stopped loading and I spent time wondering what I had borked in the code (which I also hadn't touched). Eventually I realized no static content - images, css, js, html, txt etc. - was loading properly. I ran some tests and I found that there was a cutoff point in size of content that would load, but it is somewhat arbitrary. For example, the iisstart.png image in the default IIS website does not load - it's 97K. I replaced it with an 8k file that loads fine. I could get about 1500 bytes served in an html file - 1501 bytes would send it off the rails but 1500 worked. Same sort of thing was found for text files although I was able to send more than 1500 bytes - don't remember how much but did find a point where a 1 byte difference caused a problem..Test Load of Default IIS Website:.IIS log is not helpful - it reports the failed attempt as a 200 but says it took 19 seconds. It is returning a win32 status code of 121 though:.The tracing mostly doesn't fire I guess because the 200 is eventually returned?.Fiddler gives me this for the image request:.For this site the actual html loads fine - it's only 696 bytes - the image it references does not though (97K)..If anybody can shed some light on this or give me a direction in troubleshooting I would greatly appreciate it..Thanks",question-summary-64504331,IIS stopped serving static content over a certain (small) size, iis  iis-10  static-content ,2020-10-23 17:00:28Z,Viewed 61 times,0

The 36 images were of 6 different people showing 6 different emotions. Condition 1 was with masks, 2 was without masks.I have a dataframe like this:.id = participant id.baseFace = id for image person.faceSex = gender of image person.faceEmotion = the facial expression of the image person.response = the participants response of which facial expression they think they saw.accuracy = well, accuracy.condition = if they saw condition 1 stimuli or condition 2 stimuli.My hypothesis is.1 People are better at reading facial expressions in faces without face masks.2 People will report higher levels of confidence in decisions when evaluating faces without masks.AND NOW TO MY QUESTION.Since my outcome is binary (accuracy), I use a logistic regression model:.This is to me the most logical way to build the model since I'm using condition as predictor for accuracy. The question is: Would I violate any rules or my own hypothesis if I included more predictors or random intercepts?.Here is my whole dataframe (in .csv) if it is useful:.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uEL3vVM2v_QB4Ep8AXlYIF-hZyJouQzh/view?usp=sharing.Thank you for any help..I also posted my question on StackOverflow but I was told to try here instead.",question-summary-65379866,Is my logic straight?

I was elated when I was able to get it all working, and I ran my first Transcription, and it worked!!! I did have to convert the .mp4 to a .wav file for it to work. And... the transcription isn't really all that great. If you think Siri's ""talk to text"" service makes mistakes... the transcript that resulted from my .WAV transcription was very... in the ballpark... but not perfect by any means. But, hey... I'll take it. It is a whole lot easier to scan and fix a .txt transcript than it is to sit and literally dictate it by hand..My question is... the transcripts that result from the Pocketsphinx solution have no capitalization, punctuation, or any sense of grammer. They are just a flat-out .txt file with a bunch of words that I have to go back and add punctuation too..Can any of you maybe point me in the direction of some way to either improve the transcription, or reprocess the resulting .txt file to insert some basic punctuation? I am barely literate with Python, so everything I've read online that has invoked concepts like machine learning and AI, are all way over my head. Should I just be happy with what I've been able to get?",question-summary-65113822,"Is there an open-source solution for adding basic punctuation to a Python SpeechRecognition application using CMU's PocketSphinx", python  speech-recognition  cmusphinx  pocketsphinx ,2020-12-02 18:15:24Z,Viewed 66 times,0

We are using Google's API to find top search results. However, we have found that there are inconsistent results when using different search parameters within the API query. The inconsistencies are an issue because we are trying to hone our query to a certain error rate (error rate being how many URLs provide effective research information). We are looking for someone to help explain how Google's API works, because the documentation is extremely minimal. An example of our base query: 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=KEY&cx=SEARCHENGINE&q=""School Name"" intext:(term1 | term2 | term3) -inurl:(unwanted1 | unwanted2 | unwanted3) inurl:(wanted1 | wanted2 | wanted3)&start=1'.Where ""School Name"" is the name of a higher-ed institution. Term1, term2, etc., are specific variables that we want to find in the body text of the search results. The intext parameter helps to avoid invisible text in certain documents. For example, insidehighered.com includes many higher-ed institutions in invisible text without the actual article being applicable. Unwanted 1, etc,. are words or phrases that we don't want included in the URL title. For example, we want to avoid PDF documents, so one could be "".pdf"". Wanted1, etc,. are words that we do want in the URL, like ""news"". We use ""|"" to signify ""or"", which allows us to utilize one query for multiple types of searches, thus helping to minimize the cost of our API usage..So far, we've found the following issues/inconsistencies:.Our code being used to pull the items off of each page is:.Thank you!",question-summary-65295872,"Inconsistent search results using Google's Custom Search JSON API", python  google-api  google-custom-search ,2020-12-14 20:17:05Z,Viewed 401 times,5

After some digging around I thought I understood how it worked:.VM-webfirewall IP = xxx.xx.xx.xxx our outside ip address VM-web-server IP = 10.1.1.72 our inside IP address..Webfirewall seems to run apache and has an /etc/httpd/sites-enabled folder with conf files for each of our internal websites like:.weather.abc.com database.abc.com which is all from our www.abc.com.now it has two conf files the second one always ending in -ssl.conf.So an example of two conf files:.flower.conf.then.flower-ssl.conf.So these work great! The request comes in, it goes off to our flower database and boom right away if you are offsite asks for a user name and password..This is on our web-firewall VM, now on our actual web -server VM there is another apache running with a similar /etc/httpd/sites-enabled folder. This also has a conf file:.002-flower.conf.So if you are onsite, you can just goto flower.abc.com and boom the app (it is a flask based app behind nginx running on a complete VM by itself.

This raspberry pie has a dns entry of webserver2 and also works totally fine, when on site on my work network I can goto:.covid19.abc.com and it comes up fine. I can also goto webserver2.abc.com:8080 and it comes up fine..When I am off site (not on the work network), I get the:.If I look from the web-firewall (where I believe a request should first come in) there is no entry in the access_log of anyone even trying to hit the sight. I can hit other ones like weather.abc.com and it shows the entries from my IP etc. So it is like it is not even making it to the apache portion on the web-firewall for any requests for the covid19.abc.com website.

We have my own (Nextcloud)-Server sitting in our church. This works perfectly fine and since here in Germany the community services got forbidden already once during all this Covid19-stuff, we want to have a stream-setup. I managed to set up an icecast-instance on our server and we use my old laptop with Rocket Broadcaster and a Steinberg CI2 to provide the source for the stream. That works all as intended. We already used it once because we stopped public services for two weeks after one of our member got tested positive after he went abroad for a week. Our operator on the PA doesn't want to have another display there, which would disturb him from listening the sermon..My project regarding this: I have a RPi4 and a Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD. The input atm is a standard mic, that is connected to the Interface. The Pi is configured with darkice and uses its own icecast installation, while I am testing everything at home. Since I started the streaming project, after the service we switched Rocket Broadcaster to use VLC and a folder of old service recordings (mastered and in MP3-format) to provide a source to listen while we are at work or on travels. This option gets used pretty regularly and I want to keep it going. My plan is to have a little box with a LED levelmeter, where the input level is shown. That should be done with a little python script. Also I want to add two buttons, where presets for the two setups get loaded. Button 1: kill the current source and start the darkice livestream. Button 2: kill the current source and start the playback of old recordings. Both options should have visual feedback for the operator. The raspberry has to work in headless mode without need for a VNC or SSH-connection for the normal usage..My problem: I tried: sudo killall darkice && /home/pi/darkice.sh.This code will get changed, because I probably have to use ices for the mp3-playback. So basically it kills darkice, starts the ices playback (for now only restarts the stream in a blink) and vice versa. The bash-file exists and gets executed at reboot via cronjob. That works well. When I execute the above mentioned killall command, icecast continues the broadcast almost instantly, but the stream stops on the clients. Everyone needs to restart it. Do I have an option to change the setup, so that I am able to switch between the two options without the need for everyone to restart? My plan was to create a bash-script, where I do this all inside and execute it via GPIO-input and pythoncode..Thanks in advance!",question-summary-65060199,Icecast stream switching sources without the clients stopping playback, python  icecast  raspberry-pi4 ,2020-11-29 12:43:25Z,Viewed 59 times,1

I have a choropleth map of the world that uses a date slider to update the map with the number of cases and deaths by country. I have a button that updates the map by adjusting the metrics by population..I have created two sets of color/bin/palette controls for the map based on whether or not the data is adjusted for population.

They seem to correlate with the first bin color categories..For example, when I want to look at cumulative cases and cumulative deaths adjusted for population, the numbers are much smaller, but the new color palette is still associated with the original color palette (for non-adjusted metrics), so it looks like there's no data/extremely low counts..//Ignore the missing countries in the map//.I figure the issue lies somewhere with the pal3 and pal4 arguments not being recognized.

There are several endpoints that are accessed via a class enum per context of the request from the container view.
The data accumulates in a Singleton class amongst other endpoints for quicker access via member views..One member view is displayed per endpoint..Goal: to notify the parent View after the requested endpoint has returned data for display; which in turn populates a particular member view...Problem: Needless to say, the member view is always rendered before receiving the data.
That is, it's out-of-sync..In fact, the only way to have the data seen is via a button on the container view to display the member view with the data on demand. This is NOT what I want. I want this to happen automatically upon data-source selection..My Solution: to fire off a Notification to the container view once data is available so the container view can render the appropriate member view with the data..Problem: I'm using the publisher-subscribe scenario to wait for notification so I can display the data.
But I'm confused at handling the subscriber within the container view..I was thinking of using the **NSNotification** use of a handler @Objc function vs publish/subscribe.
But I'm mixing imperative with the subjective paradigm here..The following piece of code posts the notification upon receiving data:.The following code snippet is within a function of a View to handle the Notification.
This isn't firing..Question: should I pass a publisher variable between the class & the container view from which to launch the subscriber?.I understand the cause/affect of using @State <--> @Binding in synchronous time.
But I need the have the view react asynchronously upon the conclusion of acquiring the server data..I'm not sure I can use the conventional NSNotification within the container view..The bottom line: can I get the container view to react to the end of the network session?",question-summary-64831561,What is the correct way to notify a SwiftUI parent/host View of the end a Class URLSession task?, asynchronous  swift  combine ,2020-11-14 06:40:37Z,Viewed 67 times,0

I am using RStudio for Mac v1.3.1093, and R v4.0.3..This chart, which uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to estimate infections and the level of spread, first obtains data showing new cases by day in the American state of Oklahoma. This is very quick in both the Console and R Markdown. The next part is the MCMC modelling, which is where the delays are coming..I ran it this morning and it took 2.5 hours in R Markdown, compared to 30 minutes when running the query as an R Script in the Console..I can't work out why it's SO much slower in the R Markdown version. This becomes more important because, if I run the query at a county level (say, for 10 counties), then it models this 10 times, and would therefore take 10 times longer..As a shortcut, I can simply run 2 queries, with the output of the modelling query being added into a bigger R Markdown query (e.g., by saving/reading in an RDS file).

But i get trouble when i want to giva a labels on each point. the plt.text() i write above is example to give a label on a point. it is impossible if i write one by one as same as the text code because my computer got cracked and blank after i executed that code..Anyone have any idea to give a label on each points that i write the code above? thank in advance",question-summary-68166927,Visualize scatter plot with labels on each point, python  pandas  matplotlib  scatter-plot ,2021-06-28 16:28:01Z,Viewed 46 times,1

My data set is pretty big but just for starters, I’m trying to get a 10,000 training set and 1000-2000 validation set working well first. However, after trying for days, I think I need help considering that my validation accuracy goes down the more I train while my training accuracy goes up..My data comes from the ES-EN coronavirus commentary data set from ModelFront found here https://console.modelfront.com/#/evaluations/5e86e34597c1790017d4050a. I found the parallel sentences to be pretty accurate. And I’m using the first 10,000 parallel lines from the dataset, skipping sentences that contain any digits. I then take the next 1000 or 2000 for my validation set and the next 1000 for my test set, only containing sentences without numbers. Upon looking at the data, it looks clean and the sentences are lined up with each other in the respective lines..I then use sentencepiece to build a vocabulary model. Using the spm_train command, I feed in my English and Spanish training set, comma separated in the argument, and output a single esen.model. In addition, I chose to use unigrams and a vocab size of 16000.As for my yaml configuration file: here is what I specify.My source and target training data (the 10,000 I extracted for English and Spanish with “sentencepiece” in the transforms []).My source and target validation data (2,000 for English and Spanish with “sentencepiece” in the transforms []).My vocab model esen.model for both my Src and target vocab model.Encoder: rnn Decoder: rnn Type: LSTM Layers: 2 bidir: true.Optim: Adam Learning rate: 0.001.Training steps: 5000 Valid steps: 1000.Other logging data..Upon starting the training with onmt_translate, my training accuracy starts off at 7.65 and goes into the low 70s by the time 5000 steps are over. But, in that time frame, my validation accuracy goes from 24 to 19..I then use bleu to score my test set, which gets a BP of ~0.67..I noticed that after trying sgd with a learning rate of 1, my validation accuracy kept increasing, but the perplexity started going back up at the end..I’m wondering if I’m doing anything wrong that would make my validation accuracy go down while my training accuracy goes up? Do I just need to train more? Can anyone recommend anything else to improve this model? I’ve been staring at it for a few days. Anything is appreciated.

That being the case, any time I have used an external library before I have simply added the .jar files into my library folder and used import foo.bar; or import foo.*; to use the libraries..Is there a way for me to use either of these libraries without switching build tools? For example, download the source and make the .jar's in a way that isn't overly tedious, so that I can use the libraries the same way I am used to? Or, perhaps something I'm missing that allows me to download them in that format? If not, seeing as almost every Github library I find instructs me to use it through Maven dependency, should I stop using Java with Ant altogether and start learning how to write programs using Maven?.Any insight is greatly appreciated.

Our ultimate goal is to investigate if these factors can be used to provide better/more accurate forecasts of our Y target variable..Through literature survey, we selected ARIMA model for modelling/forecasting. Our initial target variable consisted of daily values for the period starting from March. 10, 2020 up to January 31rst, 2021. Because of the length of our study period, we decided to model cumulative weekly total cases, instead of raw daily values. Our general approach is to use the first 30-35 values (weekly values) for model fitting, then the last 10-15 values for validation..We noticed that fitting a simple ARIMA model (using auto.arima under R, with the forecast package) produce fairly excellent calibration, but a poor validation. We also noticed that :.both performed poorly on validation..Arima fitting (weeks 1-32) and validation (week 33 and above) - Red: Simple ARIMA (0,0,1) fit - Blue : ARIMA (1,1,0) fit using external regressors. Black line shows observed values.Later, we noticed a substantial improvement could be attained on validation using the lagged values of our target variable :.Arima fitting (weeks 1-32) and validation (week 33 and above) - Red: Simple ARIMA (0,0,0) fit using lagged values of the modelled variable as a single regressor - Blue : ARIMA (1,0,0) fit using lagged values of the modelled variable combined with external factors as regressors. Black line shows observed values.What are your thoughts on these results ?.Is it a fairly common approach to use lagged values of the modelled variable as a regressor with ARIMA modelling ? Why adding this provides better results here?.Is it fair to compare the arima.model (using lagged values of our modelled variable) to another arima.model (using both the lagged values of the modelled variable and lagged values of our regressors as well) ?.Thanks for your time..Roland.",question-summary-66401620,Fitting an ARIMA model using lagged values of the modelled variable as regressor?, r  regression  forecasting  arima ,2021-02-27 17:38:02Z,Viewed 55 times,0

There is a queue of N patients (numbered from patient 1 at the front of the queue to patient N at the back) outside his clinic. You, his assistant, found out that for each valid i, the i-th patient has an illness level Ai..Chef treats patients based on their health, i.e. a patient with a higher illness level is always treated before any patients with a lower illness level. Chef is also fair, so he treats patients with an equal illness level based on their position in the queue, i.e. a patient ahead in the queue is always treated before a patient with the same illness level that is further behind in the queue..The first patient to be treated has to wait an hour for Chef to set up his equipment. Treating each patient also takes an hour, and Chef always starts treating the next patient as soon as he is done with the current one..The patients are a bit impatient. As Chef's assistant, for each patient, find out how long (in hours) this patient needs to wait before Chef starts treating this patient..Input.The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows..The first line of each test case contains a single integer N..The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN..Output.For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the time the i-th patient needs to wait..Constraints.1≤T≤5.1≤N≤105.1≤Ai≤1,000 for each valid i.Example Input.4.5.2 3 5 3 4.3.2 2 2.6.2 10 3 3 2 10.4.8 9 8 9.Example Output.5 3 1 4 2.1 2 3.5 1 3 4 6 2.3 1 4 2.Explanation.Example case 1: Patient number 3 has the highest illness level. Therefore, this patient just waits an hour for Chef to set up his equipment and gets treated immediately after. Patient number 5 has the next highest illness level, so they go next. They need to wait an hour for patient 3 to be treated. In total, patient 5 has to wait 2 hours. After that, both patients 2 and 4 have an equal illness level, but patient 2 is ahead in the queue, so patient 2 goes next, followed by patient 4, and then finally patient 1..Example case 2: All three patients have the same illness level, so they are treated according to their position in the queue. Patient 1 goes first, followed by patient 2, and then patient 3..Example case 3: Patients at positions 2 and 6 in the queue have the highest illness level 10. The patient at position 2 is ahead in the queue, so this patient is treated first, and then the patient at position 6 is treated. After this, the patients at positions 3 and 4 in the queue have the next highest illness level, so the patient at position 3 is treated next, followed by the patient at position 4. Similarly, afterwards, the patient at position 1 is treated, and then the patient at position 5 is treated..Example case 4: Patients at positions 2 and 4 in the queue have the highest illness level 9, so the patient at position 2 is treated first, followed by the patient at position 4, then the patient at position 1 and finally the patient at position 3..Approach.I approached the problem by storing elements Ai and index i in a vector of pairs and then sorting the vector according to Ai's to be able to access the highest levels of illness together in a sorted manner. I then started assigning hours from the first element of given Ai's in the range [1, 1000] in a descending order (higher order of illness is treated first). I came up with the following code:-.The above code passes the given the sample input but it failed the whole of the question i.e. there was a corner case which I could not identify. I've been thinking for more than a couple of hours now and am unable to think of any such case.

Trying so solve an issue I am seeing here between my Razor view and model. I have a popup window that is being fed a partial view and model..This works great on the first page render. I see the data fill my UI elements that are called from the @model on the razor page. When my user updates a field here and submits, I use this function.However, after the popup window is closed, and another popup is opened, we call that same ClickedCovid19Question IActionResult to populate our form again. It populates the UI fine with the new model it generated, debugging shows it creates a new model with all the correct data. The issue arrises when a user submits this form again, the model on the Razor view seems to think it is still the model of the very first submission. An example of this is the first line of the javascript function. When the razor view was created, it had the correct @Model.Par data, as I could see when I created a few elements to display it. However, when trying to capture that data using @Model.Par, it captures the original Model.Par data. Long story short, subsequent popups don't overwrite the Model data from the very first one. I am stumped, because this system works in so many other areas of our codebase. I can fix this buy creating hidden elements that will store the data I need to send in any requests, but I feel like there has to be a better answer than that..Edit: Below is an example I was using to test. The view part below will always display the correct par data in the id=parID input box.

However, zt_ind_solve_power from statsmodels.stats.power gives back different results and I dont understand why! Here is what I did! I calculated the expected standard error in the population, based on group sizes and standard deviations and then computed the area under the aternative curve (here: approx. distribution, based on drawn sample) right from the critical value (here: critical value based on reported p in the paper):.I am trying to solve for power by hand as part of my bachelor's thesis (I am analyzing various researcher degrees of freedom). I know that otherwise, there is no need to do that, really... What made me wonder, is that the solve_power function gives back power=1.9% for p=0.0013 and power=6.6%, which appears to be way too low to be true, here.

I've fitted a model to the raw data, however when looking at the Covid data from the UK we see a trough each weekend because testing drops, and a spike each monday/tuesday because there is a rush of positive tests from the weekend. This then if I am correct, should be considered as noise, as the peaks and troughs are not results of the the pathogen's behaviour, but instead due to human error. As such I initially thought I should fit my models to smoothed data..I have made use of a stacked bi-directional LSTM, from Tensorflow's Keras, but I am open to using other methods like GRU and ARIMA, and anything advised by you all as well..Below are a two plots, that are the results of the model:.Model fitted to raw case data:.Model fitted to 7 day rolling averages:.The model that is fitted to the raw data is slightly over-fitted which I can adjust with tweaks to the model complexity, and perhaps I'll shift to the RobustScaler() from sklearn. But I am also concerned that the model is effectively just ""learning"" the noise of the data instead of the general trend..On the other hand, the model that is fitted to the 7 day rolling average, is not over-fitted and sticks to the rolling average pretty nicely. However, unless I am mistaken and please correct me if I am; don't regression models assume independence between daily points? And when you start smoothing points, the results are directly dependent (in this case) on the previous 7 points..As such I conclude with my initial question: should I fit models to smoothed data, or stick to the raw data?.My thanks to anyone that answers!",question-summary-68658090,Should I fit predictive regression models to smoothed data?, python  tensorflow  keras  model  smoothing ,2021-08-04 21:13:08Z,Viewed 18 times,0
