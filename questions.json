This is my first attempt at webscraping; I'm pretty sure I'm using the wrong tags or findAll arguments. I've tried a couple of different combination and none work..I found a lady who did something similar to what I want here: https://towardsdatascience.com/scrape-cdc-for-covid-19-cases-a162924073ad.But she's a developer I think and her skills are above mine. There has to be a much simpler way to do this. Right?.Thanks in advance.",

And 3 of them just have some negative values of the other 3 to complete the ball..I'm just wondering if there's a way to write these for loops in a nested loop?

Scientists and researchers there have conducted a research and discovered that, in a street with houses (imagine that the houses are only on one side of the street, the other side is empty), if residents in a house were affected with the novel Coronavirus, there is a high probability for the houses on either side of that house to be diagnosed with Coronavirus as well. This will result in an extremely high possibility for almost all the houses be affected by COVID-19..Hearing this, the President of the country XYZ has decided to execute (kill) residents in some houses to save more people from that street..You will be given an input string, containing the number of residents in adjacent houses for a specific street. Your task to find the maximum number of residents that can be saved from getting infected by COVID-19..Input Format : Input string contains a set of integers separated by a space.Constraints : 1 < houses in a lane <=1000..Output Format: Print the maximum number of residents that can be saved from getting infected by COVID-19..Sample input: 3 5 3 4 3 6.Output : 15.I passed the testcase 0 but still overall my answer is wrong.",

But I would like the other column to be the corresponding text for each country. That's harder since there is nothing to isolate this.

  "question_body": "So I developed a script that would pull data from a live-updated site tracking coronavirus data. I set it up to pull data every 30 minutes but recently tested it on updates every 30 seconds..The idea is that it creates the request to the site, pulls the html, creates a list of all of the data I need, then restructures into a dataframe (basically it's the country, the cases, deaths, etc.)..Then it will take each row and append to the rows of each of the 123 excel files that are for the various countries. This will work well for, I believe, somewhere in the range of 30-50 iterations before it either causes file corruptions or weird data entries..I have my code below. I know it's poorly written (my initial reasoning was I felt confident I could set it up quickly and I wanted to collect data quickly.. unfortunately I overestimated my abilities but now I want to learn what went wrong). Below my code I'll include sample output..PLEASE note that this 30 second interval code pull is only for quick testing. I don't usually look to send that many requests for months. I just wanted to see what the issue was. Originally it was set to pull every 30 minutes when I detected this issue..See below for the code:.When I check the code after some number of iterations (usually successful for like 30-50) it has either displayed only 2 rows and lost all other rows, or it'll keep appending while deleting a single entry in the row above while two rows above loses 2 entries, etc. (essentially forming a triangle of sorts)...Above that image would be a few hundred empty rows. Does anyone have an idea of what is going wrong here? I'd consider this a failed attempt but would still like to learn from this attempt. I appreciate any help in advance.",

The values in both of these datasets grows exponentially; that means that if you had something like [3, NaN, 27] you'd want to interpolate so that the missing value is filled with 9 in this case. I checked the interpolation method in the Pandas documentation but unless I missed something, I didn't find anything about this type of interpolation..I can do it manually, you just take the geometric mean, or in the case of more values, get the average growth rate by doing (final value/initial value)^(1/distance between them) and then multiply accordingly. But there's a lot of values to fill in in my Series, so how do I do this automatically? I guess I'm missing something since this seems to be something very basic..Thank you.",

What puzzles me is, it´s not systematic.

  "question_body": "I'm trying my hand at the Kaggle COVID-19 competition (https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks) just to see if I can help. I have a question about improving the efficiency of regular expression search in a pandas DataFrame..I've organised the dataset so I have dataframe with a title, abstract and the full text of the article in each row. The goal is to search the full text for keywords using a regular expression, and then return a set in a new column. As a first step, I am searching for the virus mentioned in each article. I am also using a dataset from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses to help me identify the virus (https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/master-species-lists/m/msl/8266).While I understand that my dataset is large, and there is a lot of data in the \"Full text\" column (400,000+ lines, and 100s of words in the full text column) , my current script run has ran for 2 days non-stop. I would like to check whether if there is a way to improve it's efficiency, as I want to run other regular expression searches, and preferably not have to wait for so long..I've created a mock dataset, but with the script I am using. Is there anyway for me to improve it's efficiency?.Mock dataset.This is from the ICTV website, I downloaded the spreadsheet from the website, to replicate, please download the spreadsheet, and change the folder path.Organising the data.I've melted the dataset into a single column. Articles may mention the same virus in different conjucations (coronavirus, coronaviridae, coronavirale etc. I want to capture all versions).From my understanding, all virus names will have the stem \"vir\" in it's name, it can be at the beginning, the middle or in the end..These lines attempt to capture prefix fof the virus using a regular expressions.This converts the list returned from the regular expression to a string..This step takes all the virus in panda's series and puts it into a single string. Also, thank you for providing this code (Python: Elegant way to check if at least one regex in list matches a string).This is the code I am most worried about. It runs the regular expression, and returns what it finds to a string. The \"set\" is to remove duplicates.This line runs the code and picks up the text by row. However, as mentioned, this is taking a long time..The script returns what I want, but it is slow.I apologise for the very long entry, but I wanted to provide as much information to recreate the problem. The script works (I think), but as mentioned, the script has been running for two days..Any help would be appreciated.",

  "question_body": "I was attempting to create a quiz and one of the criteria is to limit the time available to solve for each question in the quiz. I looked up certain tutorials but some require an input of x seconds for the timer to go off while others looked more like a stopwatch....I was wondering how do I do like a background timer that ticks down as soon as the question is printed out and skips to the next question if, for example the 30-second period has ended? I'm clueless in the timer function and was having problems to even try to implement them onto my codes. Could someone give out a few pointers so I can sorta progress further in implementing a working timer?.Thank you!.EDITED section below: The timer that I want to implement onto my coding:.This is the whole coding that I tried to implement the timer into. I noticed that when I tried to define qtimer to just print 1 or 2 lines of statements the timer works but I want the timer to stop and go to second question or stop and give the user another attempt to retry the question, so I tried to attach a bunch of codes after the definition and it didn't work. I know I'm most probably doing something wrong here since I'm not quite familiar with time or threading functions. Is there a workaround?",

  "question_body": "I have been building web downloaders over the years (e.g., using Apache HTTPClient and recently JBrowser [1]). These have worked OK till recently when some sites result in certification errors. I do not understand the details, and I cannot find a simple tutorial for people who know relatively little about certificates (e.g., what one looks like and how it obtained or created). This is a request for a default explanation of the simplest case and how to fix it. Typical error:.I can access the URL through browsers (Firefox, Chrome) and get HTML which represents what I want, but cannot access this programmatically..I have read several accounts of how to fix this (e.g. [2]), but they generally refer to \"your Keystore\" or \"trust manager\" as if everyone knows what these are. I am concerned that if I don't know what I am doing, I could break security. I don't know how I add sites to these or whether I even should..I am on MACOSX and appear to have a binary file.Some of the answers suggest I should have a file called \"truststore.jks\" but don't say where this should be or how it was created..So I am asking for a simple explanation of the system components and the simplest way to fix it. In some cases, I can avoid it (e.g., by using curl from the command-line), so I don't know how much this is a Java (8) problem..EDIT: Trust Store vs Key Store - creating with keytool seems to explain the difference between KeyStore and TrustStore, but I still don't have insight into what to do..[1] http://machinepublishers.github.io/jBrowserDriver/com/machinepublishers/jbrowserdriver /JBrowserDriver.html [2] Using a custom truststore in java as well as the default one",

I started by creating a custom Country object class with getter and setter methods. Then, I stored the result I got from the network request after parsing the JSON data in an Arraylist called countries. Please see the code below.After that, in the RecyclerView Adapter class I added the getFilter() method to get a filtered ArrayList. I modified the Corona_Stats_Adapter constructor to pass in a List<Country>. But, from my Main activity when I call the Corona_Stats_Adapter constructor, How do I pass the correct ArrayList which I created by parsing the JSON Data in the CovidJSON_Utils class..Country class code.Main Activity Code..",

I have an xlsx file which contains epidemiological data about the spread and severity of COVID-19 in The Netherlands. Because the website that I scrape daily is only publicing current status rapports, I'm making data frames with trends myself. Everyday I want to append an one column data frame to a worksheet containing daily cumulative updates about the amount of people infected by COVID-19. This data frame needs to be appended at the end of the table in the first empty column. I tried this code:.addDataFrame(Meldingen, sheet = 'Meldingen', col.names = F, row.names = F , startRow = 1, startColumn = 10).But this code overwrites the data in the xlsx file instead of appending it to the the table in the worksheet.

Where cases for a particular state do not start on the same date as does Washington State (01/21/2020), the missing dates cases are represented by zero. This allows the cases array to be accessed by an index that represents a specific day across all dates. Now it is possible to map the COVID-19 cases as the spread throughout the US. For the mapping, I decided to use the same Leaflet Interactive Choropleth Map software as a template (I have no experience with current mapping software so I pretty much copied the Leaflet code). The final intent is to have a setInterval timer trigger the revision to the map. The code follows..My problem occurs in the update function. It doesn't update the graphic! Whenever the Update button is clicked, the Day Number increments but the graphic for the data for that day number does not paint. Thoughts?.Stay Safe.",

  "question_body": "I am trying to create a map that tracks COVID-19 confirmed cases by county using FIPS codes. How am I able to make this code gather the data from both of those data files?.If you run the code as is (NY times data) then the map does not fill in counties with zero cases as zero cases. This is because the NY times data does not list the data for the places with zero cases. The other data does list places with zero cases. So, whatever doesn't get filled in with the NY times data I would like to fill in with the other data set. How do I do this? Or how do I fix my problem? Also, when hovering over the map how do I make it state the county name instead of the FIPS number?.Furthermore, how do I make this a live map that auto-updates when there is new data?",

As part of this process, I'm re-coding heatmap values from continuous to ordinal format - so I have a heatmap where six colours represent specific count categories, and those categories are created from aggregated count values. However, this causes a major performance issue with the speed of the creation of heatmap using ggplotly(). I've traced it to the tooltip() function from Plotly which renders interactive boxes. Labels data from my heatmap somehow overload this function in a way that it performs very slowly, even if I just add a single label component to the tooltip(). I'm using a processed subset of COVID-19 outbreak data from Johns Hopkins CSSE repository. Here is a simplified heatmap code, which also uses The Simpsons colour theme from ggsci:.Performance improves once tooltip = c(\"text\",\"label\",\"label2\") is reduced (for instance to tooltip = c(\"text\")). Now, I know that delay is not \"massive\", but I'm integrating this with a Shiny app. And once it's integrated with Shiny and scaled with more data, it is really, really, really slow. I don't even show all variables in tooltip and its still slow - you can see it in the current version of the app when you click on 'confirmed' cases..Any suggestions? I've considered alternative interactive heatmap packages like d3heatmap, heatmaply and shinyHeatmaply but all those solutions are more intended for correlation heatmaps and they lack customisation options of ggplot..",

I want to allow the user to choose which countries they want to see using the CheckBoxGroup widget from Bokeh but my plot isn't updating. Additionally, when debugging, I noticed that the update function only updates when there is a new selection (or so it seems). When I select a country, if I print the src data from the update function, the data from the new country is present (but is not plotted). However, when I unselect a country, the data from that country is still present after it is supposed to have been updated..I don't know if the use of groupby creates a problem (I haven't seen any working examples with groupby, I tried using MultiLine but I'm not quite sure I understood the purpose)..PS : If anyone knows how to format CheckBoxGroup to have columns it would also be great, but it's far from being a priority right now..Thanks in advance !",

In order to build this model, I require the population of each location (country or province/state and/or county) to calculate the S (susceptible) in SIR. Since this dataset does not contain population data, I thought it would be good to do this using an API. I came across countryinfo, but the population estimates have not been updated since 2018 (according to the example and pypi); Also, one must be careful when entering country names as the ones accepted by countryinfo are not necessarily the same as those provided in the dataset..I can type generic queries (ie, type \"US\" or \"United States\") into google to find the population of any location, but I am not sure how to do this programmatically in python. Typing 'us' in-place of location below will show the US population (via this solution)..I think the wikipedia API can be used to the same effect, but I am not quite sure how to do this.

My hacky way of transforming the data from the country names that arent identical is with the code: covid_data.location[covid_data.location=='US'] = 'United States of America'.By doing this, the country name is now the same on both the .geojson file and the DataFrame.is now the same as.Before editing the dataframe, the map was rendered, but when US is changed to United States of America, it throws an error.return color_range[color_idx], fill_opacity IndexError: list index out of range.So that means that im setting the Choropleth threshold_scale to 636,360 (which is the highest # in the 'confirmed' column) but theres no data to match that # to. Therefore if I change the threshold_scale down to the next highest number, 177,644 (which is Italy) I get the error.ValueError: All values are expected to fall into one of the provided bins (or to be Nan). Please check > the bins parameter and/or your data..Heres the rest of the code to help resolve this issue,.You can see the image of the map (for some reason the threshold includes the USA #'s):..Let me know if theres anything else I can provide!",

I'm a relative newbie to R so.....I've done some fairly basic stuff with ggmap to plot spatial data, but never anything quite like this. Typically I just have points of interest that I need to overlay on a map, so I can use geom_point and their lat/lon. In this case I need to construct the underlying map and then fill regions and I'm struggling with doing that in the ggplot world..I've followed some online examples I've found to get as far as this:.Which produces this plot:..So far so good. But my new_counties dataframe now looks like this:.So I've lost anything that I might be able to tie back to my county level data on infections..My data has a 5-digit FIPS code for each county. First two digits are the state and last three are the county. My geoJSON file has a much more detailed FIPS code. I tried grabbing just the first 5 and creating my own data element I could map back to.But that produces this plot..And I have to say I'm not quite familiar enough with broom::tidy to know exactly why. I also notice as I type this that I need to filter out Puerto Rico!.If anybody can point me back in a useful direction....I'm not wedded to the current approach, though I would like to stick to ggplot2 or ggmap. My boss eventually wants me to overlay certain features. Ultimately the goal is to follow the example here and produce an animated map showing data over time, but I'm obviously a long way from that.",

  "question_body": "I have a Google Sheet workbook with multiple sheets being used to track COVID-19 cases in institutions across the country. The built-in Google Sheets geo chart works perfectly for the data visualization I need to accomplish, with one issue: It currently can't differentiate between actual 0 and \"no data\", which super skews how the..(essentially you can choose what color to use on the map for high value, mid value, low value, and no value. Where it should be using the color for \"no value\", it uses the low value color instead which makes the visualization confusing.).The reason it's doing that is the array it's using as its data source contains zeroes to represent \"no data available\"..The array is imported from a different sheet by using ={'State Totals'!N4:P54}. I found an explanation for how to generally use a formula to return empty cells, the example there being =if(B2-C2>0, B2-C2, \" \")..I'm extremely noob when it comes to these formulas, and I cannot figure out if I can nest an IF condition in an array import, or vice versa, or... what or how..Here's a link to the sheet in question, if that helps at all. Really I just need a formula that.I don't want to affect the origin sheet's zero handling, just the one that the chart's using. (I also am absolutely not being paid enough to try and rig up a better map with Google Data Queries instead of the in-built Google Sheets chart maker, so here's to hoping it's a simple matter of syntax.)",

  "question_body": "I am building a Rails app to pull data from the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 Github project and to calculate the daily growth rates for cases and deaths. I started this because I wanted to see the change in the data every day for my city of Nashville. Currently, I have a hard-coded html table, which you can see here, but I'm trying to make it dynamic so that it works for every county in the US..At this point I'm blocked trying to model the database and calculate the daily growth rates on a before_save callback because I'm not sure how to look up the records I need..What is a decent way to find a record in rails that is the adjacent previous record to the one you're looking up? I'm not even sure how to say that clearly in English, which is probably the root of my problem with not being able to get it into code. For instance, today vs. yesterday OR March 28th vs. March 27th OR March 31st vs March 30th, etc. I need to find the first record based on date and then find the last record from the day prior..It should be something similar to this before_save callback:.Here's the model where that callback happens..But, that approach won't work because there are times where the data might be incorrect for a previous date and it will need to get updated. For instance, the Tennessee health department might discover they had erroneous data for March 31st, so the Johns Hopkins data gets updated and thus the record in my database would need to be updated. So with my code above, the first time that happens it would call Update.last and save an incorrect growth rate for March 31st. Thus, I need the callback to work whether it's calculating the growth rate for today vs. yesterday or March 28th vs. March 27th, etc..It's an open project, so the entire app is here.

This is why i cut series, to compute my ratio i only need the n previous date/rows (past day) before the actual day i want to test..I found this computation on COVID 19 our world in data charts, but i want to compute this indicators for one country and for each day and not only the last day as picture show :)..For example, for the date 2020-03-04, i only need to compute ratio between 2020-03-04 and 2020-03-01 / 02 / 03 to find the FIRST date where ratio >=2.In this example 2020-03-04 there is no more death than 2020-03-03, so we don't want to compute a new delta ( the number of days before death multiply >=2 is the same than 2020-03-03 !). I explain this in Edit1/2 archived at the end of this post..We use a dictionary to store the first occurence of each cumulated value, so when i see that cum_value = value, i search in the dictionary to get the correct date (9 return 2020-03-03) for ratio computation..Here my actual working code to do that :.I'm not really happy with this code, i found that passing the entire DF to my apply method was weird..I'm sure there is some better code in Panda to do that in less lines, and more elegantly, using probably nested apply method, but i don't found how..The dictionnary method to store date of the first duplicate is also weird, i don't know if it's possible to do that using apply (reusing result of previous computation during apply) or if the only way was to write a recursive function..QUESTION UPDATED WITH EDIT 1/2/3, WORKING WITH DUPLICATE VALUES.EDIT ARCHIVED.Edit 1 :.I see that my code doesn't take in account when there is value equal at zero..2020-03-03 computeValue is equal to 3.0 and not 2.0, dela is equal to 2.0 days and not 1.0 days (like 2020-03-02).I cannot access previous values during apply computation, so i search another way to do that..Edit 2 :.Found a way passing a pre-computed dictionnary :.Now, when i found a cum_value equal to some value, i return the index used for computation.",

They live in their own GitHub repositories and are served using GitHub Pages. Right now each of these repositories has a copy of all the files except the ones that are part of the theme. Somewhat inconveniently, I have no previous experience with Jekyll, Ruby or GitHub Pages..I know there are multilingual jekyll tricks, but that is not what I am here for, mostly because I want sites on different domains..So I decided that it might be good to hijack the theme as a store for files common to my sites. So I made a test copy of my site without the common files. It uses as \"remote_theme\" a copy of the theme where I stuck my common files in the theme's assets directory, so they get pulled in by the different language sites. This works for images, PDF files and such: I just move them to /assets/images in the theme and it all works..However, next to data files local to each language, such as the menu below our site title, I also have some common data files, such as the list of languages that the site is available in and the list of volunteers we thank for their work. I'd like to also place these in the theme somehow so I don't have to commit them to all the repos separately... Cannot get this to work..What I have tried:.Adding _data to the regexp in the .gemspec file of the theme where it reads: f.match(%r{^((_includes|_layouts|_sass|assets)/|(LICENSE|README)((\\.(txt|md|markdown)|$)))}i).Does not lead to the data files being accessible.Creating dummy _data files that {% include the real ones from the theme's _include dir..\"found character that cannot start any token while scanning for the next token\".Set data_dir in _config.yml to assets/data.I can use the data files that are site specific just fine, but the data files on the theme side are not seen by the Liquid processing. (They are copied to the _site directory along with the site-specific ones.).Is there a way to have a GitHub Pages site with some data coming from its own files and some data coming from the theme files? I realise I'd probably have to rebuild the site to make the theme changes show. (Right?) (Is there a way to trigger a rebuild on GitHub Pages other than to change files? What does the version number on the theme do?).Is there a more in-depth writeup of how the files from the theme and the site get mixed and what order things happen in than the jekyll user documentation?.Please by all means also tell me if there's a much better, simpler and/or more elegant way to do what I am trying to accomplish.

  "question_body": "I'll apologize in advance that the example below isn't \"minimal\" but I haven't been able to reproduce this behavior except in the particular instance of my full data set..I asked this question before here and thought I had found the answer, but the behavior has returned and is vexing me. Basically I have a script that reads daily COVID-19 case numbers and produces maps where the counties are color-coded by the percent of the population infected. The script produces five maps, a national one and one for each of the four official census regions: northeast, midwest, south and west. To cut down on size, the below is just the national and widwest maps..My original script actually produces animated gifs showing the spread of the disease, but they take a long time to render. The below version just gives a single plot of the most recent data and should run pretty quickly..I've used a dput in the below script to avoid you having to read a file and geocode locations (I commented out the code) but there is still a large csv file of county populations that has to be read in. I have posted it at pastebin here..This is the national map I got this morning when I ran the code..Note that there is a scale for the number of personnel at the bases (the colored diamonds) but there is no scale for the shading of the counties..Here is the midwest map. You can see from the code that it is the same ggplot just with a dataset that is filtered down to the counties in the midwest region...Now the scale is there. As mentioned in my previous question I thought that the answer had been something to do with the width of the image being insufficient to accommodate the scale. When I added a newline in the legend text to shorten it that appeared to do the trick. But now the legend is disappearing again, andmaking the output image wider has no effect. Plus, just by eyeball it would appear there is plenty of room in the national plot to accommodate the scale..Another bizarre aspect is the behavior associated with rounding the breaks. Below is a west map where I applied no rounding to the breaks..So the scale is back but it goes to 6 decimal places. If I try to round it to 2.I get this map..which surely indicates the horizontal space isn't the issue...if it can accommodate 6 decimal places then surely there's room for 2?.I've spent as much time trying to figure out this inconsistent scale behavior as I spent writing the original script. I need these things to be consistent so that I can provide them as work products on a regular interval.",

The nodes that I am wanting to retrieve are Name, Address, City, State, Zip. The closest that I have gotten with this is from the stack post Read multiple layers of KML file using R..For this first attempt, my code looks as follows:.However, when doing so, I am getting the following error and warning:.Error in readOGR(\"Distilleries and Hospitals.kml\", \"Distilleries\") :\nno features found In addition: Warning message: In ogrFIDs(dsn = dsn, layer = layer) : no features found.Now, I am able to read the layers stored in the lyr variable..The code below will produce a list of 7..Next, I tried to just pull from he one layer with the following code:.This resulted in the following error and warning (same as above):.Error in readOGR(\"Distilleries and Hospitals.kml\", \"Distilleries\") :\nno features found In addition: Warning message: In ogrFIDs(dsn = dsn, layer = layer) : no features found.Finally, I tried to use a similar approach with the lapply using the sf package..I get 7 0x3 lists with no information..Any assistance with this would be wonderful..One final note, if you do end up getting the file from the website instead, please note that there are several instances near the end of the file where R won't read the file (at least not for me) because of special characters. The error will tell you where this is when using the sf function..Thank you for your time on this..KML File at Dropbox for Download (~28mb).Edit 1: From a comment left below, it seems that the layers are empty in this file. If that is accurate, then the question is, how would I get the data I need out of this file and into a CSV file..Edit 2: Further Investigation the KML document it appears that all of my information may be found within the placemark tags (...). However, I am not certain how to pull that data out. This is the ultimate goal. If these are not layers, then it would be great if someone could point me in the direction to solving this. Again, I want to thank you in advance for all of your help..Edit 3 Data Excerpt and Python Attempt: I have manually manipulated the file to remove everything that I am not really interested in having in the long run. Below is a small excerpt of the file. It lists the first three companies..Since I have had no luck with R, I have added my Python attempt below. I am hoping. However, with the added data, if someone is able to do this in R, I will be happy with that as well..What I am trying to get is first the name. Then from the extended data section, I am looking ultimatly to get Address 1, Address 2, City, State Abbreviation, and Zip. I am fine if I end up with everything so long as it puts an empty field where there is no data. For example, Address 2 is often empty, just return an empty field and keep moving so that when I merge the lists, everything lines up..The example below only attempts to get Name and Address Line 1. I figure, if I can get this, then I should be able to extend it all the way..The additional code that I have tried is below:.When I run this, I get the first record with the first address line 1 perfectly, but I also get the following error:.AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'.I believe that this is because in the first record, Address 2 is empty. Therefore, I believe that this is trying actually pull everything at once from the extended Data which is also not what I want..The real difficulty I am having is pulling the <Data name = \"...\"> ... </Data> fields..This is my first crack at XML/KML parsing, so any help I would greatly appreciate. I really have not a clue what to try next at this point..End file will be a CSV file with headers: Name, Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip. Honestly, I am also fine just getting rid of Address 2 as well. It's not critical to have..If you need further clarification, please just ask. Thank you in advance for your time.",

  "question_body": "I have just one Cassandra node, installed locally on my PC with Windows 10 (Core i5, 16GB ram, SSD drive)..I created a table like this:.The pesel is unique, 10-digits id of a person..Then I generated 10 000 rows of sample data, that looks like this:.Finally, I loaded the data using cqlsh: source 'cases.cql';.To load 10 000 rows it takes 51 seconds. Is that normal?.I was expecting inserts to Cassandra to be ultra fast, while this pretty much comparable with SQLite without transaction (59s). If I wrap inserts with BEGIN & COMMIT in SQLite, this takes less than a second. This brings us to another problem....Batch inserting. Slow batch inserting. To single partition, on single node..I wrapped inserts with BEGIN BATCH and APPLY BATCH;. After that, the source was taking so long, I stopped measuring after passing 4 minutes mark..Yes, I am aware of wrong usage of batch inserts. As far as I understood, it is an anti-pattern to use batch insert if it would require inserts to different partitions, which makes sense. This is not the case here..Why is batch inserting so slow on single node (thus single partition)?.What am I missing here?",

Then, I scheduled the run of this script every hour through the functionalities of the cronR package..Here's my code:.When I manually run my script everything is ok and the .csv produced is fine, but if you try to schedule the run of this script through the cronR package (from RStudio IDE click on Addins -> Schedule R scripts on Linux/Unix) the .csv saved is different just for the column \"Date\". In fact, the dates of the first dataset are on the first column, but the dates of the second dataset (to bind to the first through bind_rows()) are at the end of the dataset, and the header has a new strange name (as you can see from this image)..Do you have any idea of what could be the problem?

BeautifulSoup is unable to gather that information, so I have decided to use Selenium. However, I am having trouble using Selenium to access the articles that are displayed..I would like to make a scraper that checks periodically for new articles, these articles would have a URL of: https://www.fxstreet.com/news...(endpoint)..However, when I try to look up hrefs/'a' tag, I get many links throughout the website, but none of them are the news articles featured in the live feed. When I look up every single 'div' I get the whole html laid out for me:.telling me that it exists somewhere, somehow, but I am completely unable to interact with it. So how do I access the links that I need when Selenium is unable to search for 'a' tags, or partial links? I have also tried to look for the exact link using:.To no avail. I have also tried putting explicit and implicit waits. Thanks.",

  "question_body": "I'm a student and attending university lessons from home. My teacher just gave me this job, consisting to take all the titles and subtitles from an online italian journal that include the words \"coronavirus\" and / or \"covid 19\" in a certain time lapse (from 22th to 29th of January and just the 1st and the 8th of April), and transcribe them to an Excel file to analyze the words used..I searched online and assumed that this could be considered scraping, and that made my day considering that I should find something like 100-150 titles plus subtitles and I have a very short deadline. Unfortunately, I am also a beginner at this and all I could do by myself was finding a way to collect just the title from the webpage. I'm using, like a beginner is supposed to, Data Miner with Google Chrome..Practically I should find all titles and subtitles from the website \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" (whose link I attach below) that contains the words \"coronavirus\" and/or \"covid 19\" but there is a problem: I can see just the titles in the search page, but to get the subtitles I should click on the article and go to another page. Is there a way to obtain all the results with Data Miner or should I use another program?.So, just to make it simple: I can't figure out how to make Data Miner collect the title from the search page, click it to go on the article page, collect the subtitle and go back to the search page to pass to the next title and subtitle and repeat. I don't know if this is possible or it's just sci-fi, like I said: I'm a total newbie at this and it's the first time using these kind of tools..Url: https://www.gazzetta.it/nuovaricerca/home.shtml?q=coronavirus&dateFrom=2020-01-22&dateTo=2020-01-29",

  "question_body": "I'm embarking on an ambitious RStudio project, one that's similar to Jack Dougherty's On the Line collaborative book-in-progress about Hartford. I'm finding I need to keep several different kinds of notes: on the research itself, on my R coding, on how to use certain tools, on my configurations, etc..Initially, I just want to keep a diary focused on the background technology: how I configured the RStudio project itself, what packages I installed, why I started to use Packrat but then deleted the project and started over, that bookdown needs certain yaml fields in its index.Rmd file to work properly (took me a day to find this out), and so on. I figured I can't be the first person to have a need for record-keeping like this..So I started by looking for an R package, an RStudio addin, or a R Markdown template or literate programming that could insert dated entries, maybe handle tags, etc. Having no luck, I started to learn about the blogdown package..Soon I decided this is overkill. While I probably should start a blog about the book's subject (the crisis triggered by the coronavirus), this would not be the place to keep records of subjects like how to make bookdown work with a non-standard directory structure. Also, blogdown wants its own project directory, which sort of breaks the connection to the original project. (The blog and research project subdirectories do share a common parent, but this seems awfully kludgy.).So I came back to the idea of including this diary in the original bookdown project. But I know no other way to do this than with an Rmd file, which (I think) cannot automatically insert accurate date-time stamps in individual posts, use tags, etc. Since I'm so new to some of this stuff, I'm writing here to ask those of you with more experience, \"What's the best way to meet this common need?\" Can you recommend any tools that will serve this purpose well?",

I can download data from cdc, and put them in a spreadsheet where there is a graph and it works just fine but I have a problem with axis scale. When you try to compare a countries sum of cases to the sum of deaths for example, deaths are too few and the graph isn't right. So I am trying to find a way to add deaths in this example but have them show in secondary (right) vertical axis. Is there a way to to this?.Edit: to be more precise My script gets the data from ecdc, puts it in sheets, shorts it to be usable and then puts it in a sheet with a premade chart, changing the data. Number of columns isn't always constant, some may be blank. Works fine for one category of data. What I need is to be able to add another set of data to be able to add a range as series in the chart but in a secondary axis..My \"code\" looks like this.2 problems here. 1 It works when I change one series to right vaxis, but as soon as I do a second, first reverts to left axis. 2 I don't know how to get a list of series in the chart with their index so that even if I make it to work I must guess which series have what data.Edit: I changed the code and it now holds the changes but I still want to get a list of series in the chart with id's and series header so I know what to change. here is an example https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_bTj8e3FZpbhdENwN9CdLYsqkJeqp313CGCJmPNtrr4/edit?usp=sharing",

  "question_body": "I'm trying to run an extension of V3 of the Imperial College London COVID model (their github repo is here: https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model). The only things I've changed are adding data for the four large Canadian provinces to the data from the 14 European countries for which the model is built, and extending the forecast to 30 days into the future (the default is 7, but the code is designed to allow this kind of extension)..The core function of the model is to estimate expected daily death tolls based on country fixed effects and the interventions that are in place to slow down the virus. It also produces expected death tolls under a counterfactual scenario where no interventions are ever used (e.g. the only thing that affects death tolls is the predicted total infections and the infection fatality rate), in the generated quantities block of the stan code..Every time I run it, though, I get warnings like these:.E_deaths0 refers to expected deaths given no mitigation interventions on day 128, the last day of the forecast, in region 18 (June 2 in Quebec, in this case)..the code for generating these estimates is.Where prediction0[i, m] is the estimated infections on day i in country m, N2 being the total number of days to estimate (128). ifr_noise[m] is a modifier for the infection fatality rate in country m, and f_rev[m] is a vector of probabilities of dying on each day after being infected. There's no reason any of the elements that go into calculating E_deaths0 would ever be NA, and while prediction0 is estimated at 0 in a lot of samples for late dates and the later values of f_rev[m] round to 0, that doesn't seem like it should cause a problem because no division is happening..This happens for different geographies each time. The dates also vary, although it's always the last n days of the simulation in a given region, with n between 1 and 8 or so. I assume the problem is in sub_col(prediction0, 1, m, i-1), because f_rev[m] is data, so there's no potential for sampling issues, and if ifr_noise[m] were taking NA values then all dates for geography m would fail. I don't see how, though, because prediction0 is generated immediately before E_deaths0 and never causes warnings..When I extract predictions of E_deaths0[128,18] or whichever estimates have problems in that run from the model fit, there are as many samples as I'd expect and they're all in a plausible range. I'm not sure whether I can trust those results, though, when the process to generate them throws random warnings..Anybody have experience with issues like this, or any ideas? Thanks.",

  "question_body": "This is the page I am trying to make it dynamic by enabling cross-filtering. So the thing is they are having multiple API..For the top first two: TOTAL CASES & DAILY CASES They are using this API and the third one in the top is based on this API..The bottom three AGE, GENDER, and NATIONALITY are from this API..In all the API one thing is common that is a date but there are some API in which some data are missing for few dates like there is a gap( Not available for some of the dates)..So I thought of combining all the JSON API in terms of dates and then allow cross filter because I believe I can enable cross-filtering between them. Correct me If I am wrong..Like If I click on gender female since it gives info about total cases where the patient was female so only confirmed cases from the Total cases will change not the recovered, deaths as data is not available. SO I guess I should combine the top 3 charts together and gender, age and nationality charts, together. Then Dc js would be able to handle nicely filtering between each segments (cases related to landmark, cases related to person info)..Line 123:.This is not working because I can't see console.log() output..https://blockbuilder.org/ninjakx/8c48ab6481311aa0452046d66c4d8701.So my questions are:.1) Why d3.queue is not working?.2) Suggestion whether combining all the datas together and allowing a filltering is a good idea or not as there is limited data. Should I go for cross filtering between the same api charts. So in this case I will have 2 segments (cases related to landmark, cases related to person info).. Using DC js I want to make it more interactive and display more info.",

  "question_body": "This may look like a duplicate question but believe me there is something new that I have observed with twitter..I had previously made a twitter scraper that fetches a given number of tweets using scrolling and waiting for dynamic elements. But it doesn't seem to work now. It doesn't scrape more than 10 tweets. Also the tweets that it scrapes is just the last 10 tweets (of all the tweets I load initially through scrolling).This function is supposed to scrape atleast n tweets. Roughly 10 tweets show up at the start. So I scroll the page n/10-1 times to load all the n tweets. Then I scrape all the div's with a particular class name..What I tried? I tried loading as many tweets I needed by scrolling to the bottom of the page, scrolled back up to the start of the page and then fetched the required elements. This is giving StaleElementError..I suspect this to be the reason for this: In the webpage when I scroll down so that a specified number of tweets load up and then return to the top of the page, the tweets that I had previously loaded disappear..I am looking for a simple and a standard way to solve this problem.

Here is an example of what I have done so far:.The finished project should look something like this, but with rates of change on all countries: https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-opioid-epidemic/.First of all, the API is a community project and in development and I don't want to overload their system with requests, so I am trying to structure my project so as to minimize the amount of load that I put on their system. I'm - quite simply - not aware of what good/bad practices are with regards using apis, and I don't want to be \"that guy\"..As I said above, I also need to think about storing the data and updating it at appropriate intervals. It is time series data for 248 countries, and recording several variables, all of which will need to be manipulated in pandas and appended to regularly. Should I build one massive dataframe? Should I build a dataframe for each country, each variable?.Once I have created the dataset, I am hoping to update & append it using similar code to what I have above, using this api call: https://api.covid19api.com/summary.Is that a good plan and what should it look like?.My plan is to host on Heroku (or something similar), when it is finished..Thank you very much if you are still reading at this point. I know this is a very long-winded post, and I am asking a lot of questions in one go. I have been trying to think about how to proceed with this all afternoon, and I know that I need to make some fundamental decisions in order to proceed.

However, after converting my Large SpatialPolygosDataFrame into a normal data frame with the fortify function and merging my corona information data set with the data frame of polygon data, the plot does not come out correctly anymore. I know that the cause is probably the order column, which is now not ordering the coordinates correctly anymore and has random jumps as you can see in the data frame. This is causing ggplot to incorrectly plot the coordinates in the right sequence. Does anyone know how I can reorder my entire dataframe by the column order. So the \"order\" column is ascending and all values around it are included in the reorder?.",

I am using 3 csv files from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases to produce graphs to track the covid 19 epidemic. These are purely for my use to learn Python and Data Visualisation. I have changed the dates in row one to be Day1, Day2 ect, dropped the Province/State, Lat, Long columns and set the Country/Region column as the index. Each dataset now has 107 columns and 267 rows. The three datasets are cases, deaths and recover. Things are going ok but I have a slight problem and need some advice. The graphs are updated with a new column each day and this causes me some problems when I try write code to show the daily increase in numbers from today over yesterday. Currently I have to manually update my code each day to compensate for the extra columns in the 3 csv files as my code reads like:-.So the last line has to be copied, pasted and then updated each day. There has to be a better way of achieving this but new to coding as I am, I cannot seem to get my head around it and figure it out. Any advice, pointers, help on how to look at and approach this problem would be greatly appreciated.

I mean, how many cases that are positive have any comorbility (obesity, etc) or not. And then, have a plot between the comorbilities and dead of the patient, in order to see if there is a correlation between having tabaquism or diabities with the dead or intubation of a patient.\nProblem is, that I really don't know how to do it, because the things I graph relate to dates so I can do a line plot, but when I come to this kind of plots I really don't know the way to go.\nI have read a lot for doing this but I really can't find an example that related to the things I want to do...

I can get the data from the following api https://api.covid19api.com/total/dayone/country/United%20Kingdom but it return me the total commutative cases and total commutative deaths on the given date. The data returned is in the following structure.Where Confirmed is the total number of cases detected on that day. To calculate the daily cases on the specific day we can subtract the confirmed from the previous confirmed of previous date. For example 2020-05-05 the number of cases confirmed on that day can be calculated by subtracting the number of cases on 20-05-04 the previous day. So the calculation would be 194990- 190584 = 4442. For the first object of the array the value stays the same since there is no previous record to subtract from as I will be fetching the day one when a case was detected in that country. Therefore the desired data would be the following.I am using Vue.js I think this could be a basic javascript function which can loop through the array and subtract the \"Confirmed\" of current object from the \"Confirmed\" of previous object. Please do let me know how this can be acheived. Many Thanks",

  "question_body": "I'm not much good with Git, and I'm still using Dreamweaver, if that tells you anything about where I'm at..I have two website branches, one for normal operations (which is currently on ice, but must be updated from time to time to keep up with changes) and one for a truncated COVID version..I switch from the COVID branch to the Hotfix branch (normal ops), make a change to a single file (not in Dreamweaver, but to a PDF), and duck back in to Gitkraken, only to find one of several things:.A) Gitkraken shows a hundred or so changes on the Hotfix branch that I most certainly didn't make, and they appear to be changes that were made on the COVID branch months ago. This doesn't happen with all files, just 80-100 (no rhyme or reason as to which ones). I can't figure how these changes seem to be \"leaking\" from one branch to another while I'm simply making changes to a single PDF..OR.B) Gitkraken shows dozens of new files that are numerated duplicates of existing files (\"file.html\" is duplicated, and a new file is showing in the repo branch called \"file 2.html\") Again here, this isn't all files, only a couple dozen (sometimes more)..In either case I end up abandoning the branch and creating a new one from the last time I saw Hotfix behaving as expected..It's been doing the latter (B) for a while now, but since it was only really a nuisance (I can delete a few duplicate files) I've been mostly ignoring it..However, the \"leaking\" changes has the potential to be crippling and to destroy my hotfix branch, and my ability to go back cleanly to the normal ops version when this stuff all ends. I keep dreading looking at the repo and seeing a hundred or more file changes in there I didn't make. This \"leaking\" has only started happening this morning, far as I can tell, but I've already had to abandon two new branches. If I end up doing this again, it will meet the definition of insanity..Now I just ducked back into Gitkraken after a system restart, (with Dreamweaver still closed so I can take it out of the equation) and now my COVID branch is showing the same behavior in reverse! 98 Changes from Hotfix are now showing in COVID branch..I'm beside myself.

  "question_body": "Background Information.I trained a classifier to predict three labels: COVID/Pneumonia/Healthy based on chest X-Ray images. It's a PyTorch implementation of COVID-Net. I use a training set to train on, validation set to save the best performing model, and then a test set to measure the \"real\" performance of the model. However, I noticed that my model \"learned\" to classify normal/pneumonia really good, but it just ignored the underpopulated COVID set. Therefore I choose to undersample (reduce the number of training instances of the other classes (normal and pneumonia) in order to get equal populations). This worked well, but my sample set has been reduced to ~1500 samples (low!). The results are somewhat worse than COVID-Net, I achieve an accuracy of ~80% and lower sensitivity on underpopulated classes (COVID) then they report. I suppose that they report better performance because they do not use a validation-set and use the test-set each epoch. I figured that they might indirectly overfit on the test-set because of that. I have chosen to explain this so that the reader gets a context..Question.I tried adding privacy to the training procedure by using Differential Privacy. Specifically, I used Facebook's PyTorch-DP module. Training works just as well if I choose to add almost no-privacy (this can be achieved by choosing a really low noise multiplier value (sigma), i.e. 1e-7) and a really high delta. So it's not that the module itself is not working/faulty, but, if I use a lower sigma (so I add more noise) then I get more privacy (epsilon decreases) but the model fails to fit the data at all. The question is: how do I manage to add privacy to a somewhat meaningful degree while making sure that my model somewhat fits the data still?.Performance differences.Confusion Matrix of Model without Differential Privacy added. It's not \"good\" but it's at least somewhat meaningful and the model reaches an accuracy of ~80%..Confusion Matrix of Model with Differential Privacy (epsilon: 2.3) after 100 epochs. It looks as if the model does not know what to do, at all..Possible explanations.I read a paper that stated that adding Differential Privacy can cause bad performance in the sense that the accuracy decreases for underpopulated classes. But, I used undersampling and I think this should've solved that, but the accuracy stays bad (for all classes!)..Maybe because my sample set is so small, differential privacy is much harder to achieve, and therefore the performance is bad? However, even if add a really tiny bit of privacy, with an epsilon value >20000, the model still struggles in learning how to classify. So I'm not sure.",

  "question_body": "I have noticed that the Stanford default entity mention tags don't merge with my new tags. For example; I want to find and tag telephone numbers. +1 234-567-8901 before my tags get run, Standford tags \"+1\" as \"NUMBER\" and \"234-567-8901\" also as \"NUMBER\" however, they remain as separate tags. I have tried creating my own TokensRegex rule to find these and mark them as \"TELEPHONE_NUMBER\". They are successfully changed to the new tag, but they remain separate tags..I have also noticed that this happens when tagging text and digits. Say if I wanted to tag \"my number is 234-567-8901\" then it would tag \"my number is\" as one tag and \"234-567-8901\" as a separate tag. I have tried using the B-TELEPHONE_NUMBER and I-TELEPHONE_NUMBER tags as mention in the documentation and it does remove the B and I, but they remain separate tags. I have noticed this behavior only happens with Stanford's tags. I have tested it with DATE and it does the same thing.So, my question is, how can I get Stanford's tags to merge with mine? If they can't be merged, is there a way to delete that tag and then add my own tag?.EDIT.here is another example of the tags not merging together..This snippet is suppose to catch covid 19.However, 19 is tagged as a NUMBER before this rule is run. it tags covid as CORONAVIRUS and changes 19's tag from NUMBER to CORONAVIRUS. It's suppose to then combine the two into one entity mention, but it doesn't. When it comes across corona virus, which is also separated into two tokens, it combines the two into one entity mention..EDIT 2.I decided to make a small pipeline to replicate the issue. I based it off the example found here https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/tokensregex.html I made modification to more closely replicate the one used in our pipeline. here is the function.Here is the output.As you can see the tags like COMPANY are merged into one mention when next to each other. However, like I mentioned above, covid 19 remains separate. This happens when a portion of the tokens already have a tag. In this case 19 was NUMBER.",

  "question_body": "If this question is better put in CrossValidated, let me know. Thought I'd start here, since it's primarily a question about a specific error, which happens to be in a machine learning algorithm, rather than a question about approaches or methods..I'm working on a machine learning project to forecast the number of deaths by US county from COVID on Kaggle. To tune the hyperparameters of the random forest regressor, I'm using sklearn's RandomizedSearchCV class, but fitting it throws a IndexError: positional indexers are out-of-bounds, though the traceback only references the pandas module. This does not happen when normally fitting the random forest regressor without the RandomizedSearchCV and using a simpler splitting method (no cross validation)..At first I thought it might be to do with the range of values that I passed to it, but I reduced the values for each parameter and all parameters, but get the same problem..My current suspicion is that it's in the custom cross validation class that I'm using to do a split on multiple time series (MultipleTimeSeriesSplit in the code), but it seems to work on the training data just fine. It doesn't work on the labels alone, since the splitting depends on the fips_target column in the features. Im not confident that this is the current issue either, since attempting to split the labels results in a missing column error, not a positional index error..What is causing this IndexError? How can I get it functioning?.The following code is for Kaggle, but if you're not on it, you should be able to download the necessary data set here..This minimal example does not include the functional fitting of the random forest regressor without cross validation, nor the other models that I'm testing out, nor the demographic data that I joined to the covid data..The existing answer does not address my error.

I can then generate a chart for every one of the states, but I can't get my x-axis labels (the dates) to behave like I want. There are two problems which I suspect are related. First, there are too many labels -- usually matplotlib tidily reduces the label count for readability, but I think the subplots are confusing it. Second, I would like the labels to read vertically; but this only happens on the last of the plots. (I tried moving the rotation='vertical' inside the for block, to no avail.).The dates are the same for all the subplots, so -- this part works -- the x-axis labels only need to appear on the bottom row of the subplots.

The example is for the JHU Covid 19 data. They update a csv file for confirmed cases and deaths (US and Global) by adding new data every day so the file grows by one column per day. Sample file I've built this application www.coronaviruscharts.net but I'm not sure my approach was the correct one. I parse the csv file and create individual files for each month, then load those files to a MySql database. My entity classes map to the individual month tables. I have a DAO for each month, and services to get data for each month. This means I have to create new entities and services for every month but the code is identical except for the entity I reference. For example, I have a JanuaryService, FebruaryService etc. The alternative seemed to be to avoid parsing the original file into individual months and loading the data to one table, but then I thought I would have to rebuild the application every day to add a new filed to account for the new day's data.",

But, I don't understand how validation accuracy of the VGG model doesn't look like an exponential curve instead it looks like a horizontally straight line or a fluctuating horizontal line. And besides, the simple 3-layer CNN models seems to perform better. Is this due to gradient vanishing in VGG model ? Or the image itself is simple that deep architecture doesn't benefit?

Here is how its structure looked like looked like:\ntable1.I formatted this table to be a little bit more manageable..Here is the structure that I ended up going with: table2.So as you can see from table one, each individual had multiple diseases and I was curious about \"how connected\" they are so I created table3..Where we have all unique diseases as the columns (in this case that was over 500 columns) and each row represents a unique disease. So we will end up with a 500X500 table. So with all that said let's get to my question: How could I make my code, that will result in table3 more optimal, than it is now, becouse it takes a bit too much time for it to compile(around 240 seconds with 500 unique diseases).

  "question_body": "I've been stuck on this for a few hours now and would love some help. Im trying to make a CSV file in Java to track covid cases per case type per province in Canada, but I'm running into an issue. Essentially I need to have the CSV with the headers of \"Date\", \"Province\", \"Confirmed\", \"Deaths\", \"Active\". I am able to obtain the data for a specific case type(\"Deaths\", or \"Confirmed\", or \"Active\"), but im unsure of what data structure to use to efficiently add it into a table or matrix. I've thought of using a HASHTABLE or HASHMAP, but the issue becomes what would i use as my value as dates will appear twice and province is obtained from the set. Some advice on what data structure to efficiently implement this would be great. I obtain the data as a JSON using this API: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest , and I can pull the data for specific dates and case types. I just cant think of a good way to merge the data together without having to do it linearly over everything. I'm thinking of maybe using a HASHSET, but i dont think this will work. Where i parse the case type individually, then merge each set together, so that duplicated values don't appear, append this into a JTABLE, then move on to the next object. I know that the lengths of each array that has my data are the same. Example of Data for Recovered. I have two other data sets that look like this.

So rather than starting from scratch, I'm importing the new data in the format the model was coded for. The new data looks like this.....The new data files are broken up into a Confirmed file, a Deaths file and a Recovered file. Each file is 267 rows and goes out to column EH with a new column added daily. I have a macro for each file. The Confirmed file takes about a minute - minute and a half to run. And when done it looks like this.....I don't import any of the confirmed = 0 data points. I've added the population/pop density columns to delete all the countries I don't care about (those with population = 0). This file has about 6800 rows and of course, this will also grow daily. When the Confirmed file is imported, of course the next thing is Deaths. When I try to import the Deaths file excel goes to 'Not Responding' state and doesn't finish. I've waited on the Deaths macro for about an hour before I killed it and it's still not done.

Stocks with their initial values set to the parameter array that was successfully loaded by the function are all zero even though the parameter array shows values (when run). Initial value: ParameterArrayName..e. When I set the parameter array values through the value editor the stocks initialize correctly..My suspicion:.I'm thinking that the issue has something to do with the internal timing within the entrails of the model generated by Anylogic such that the function to load the parameters is executed after the stocks get initial values - but that could just be the delirium caused by repeatedly smashing my forehead into the wall. But, if this is indeed the case, how can I sneak the function in earlier or, better yet, how would someone who actually knows what they're doing accomplish this?.What I'm trying to accomplish:.As a septuagenarian with lots of time on my hands and a vague recollection of dynamic modeling using Dynamo from a Systems Science program in the early seventies (and not used since), I thought I'd take a whack at age-based modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to see, among other things, whether establishing elder-prisons (in now vacant Club-Meds, Sandals... I'm sure) would be an economically advantageous strategy. Getting there requires dis-aggregating classic SIR approaches into age-specific chains of causality. So far, I'm at 27 age-specific parameters for eight age-groups and 24 scalar parameters. As much as I'd like to type and retype... all this data I'm really hoping there is a better way..I must say that I am amazed at how far modeling has come in only 50 or so years and I am enthralled with Anylogic's application - even though it's a bit java-ish for me..Thank you ever so much,.Carl Cottrell.Equivalent parameter arrays - one with values entered in edit the other read from excel file through a function",

  "question_body": "My goal is to use Python and its requests library to extract sequence data from the C3.ai Data Lake using its fetch API. Using the resulting JSON, I plan on using the pandas library to create a dataframe that stores a bunch of sequence meta-data from the BiologicalAsset objects, along with columns for the actual sequence, its length, and its sequenceType fields, which come from the Sequence object. This data is printed and is then moved to R for further viewing of the results. However, I am having trouble getting the data that I want from C3.ai and I am not sure why..In the code below, I specify that I am including the Biological Asset as well as the sequence child object, the length, and the sequence type. This is all working correctly because I am receiving a dataframe with all of the correct columns after I flatten the JSON with json_normalize(). I use the \"filter\": \"sequence.length >= 28900\", to filter out any sequences that are too short to be a complete genome. The problem is that I am only getting 105 results the fit this criteria and I know this is false because the NCBI Coronavirus data hub has almost 3000 sequences that it flags as complete. Futhermore, filtering for nucleotide sequences that have valid sequences in the child object using \"filter\": \"assetType == 'nucleotide sequence' && exists(sequence.sequence)\", yields the same result. Using \"filter\": \"exists(sequence.sequence)\", shows that there are only 1314 sequences of any type, including protein sequences, that actually have data in their child sequence object. Running these same searches using the sequence fetch API \"https://api.c3.ai/covid/api/1/sequence/fetch\" and the appropriate length and existence filters has given me the same numbers..Browsing a table I made using an sequence fetch I made to retrieve all possible sequences by using no filter, I found that the sequence objects themselves existed for probably all of the sequences I need, but that the actual sequence fields themselves are missing. Is this an issue with my approach or with the Data Lake?.Thanks for your help!.Link to NCBI COVID 19 hub.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?VirusLineage_ss=Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome%20coronavirus%202%20(SARS-CoV-2),%20taxid:2697049&SeqType_s=Nucleotide&Completeness_s=complete.Biological asset fetch code.Sequence fetch JSON with possible filters commented out.",

I use the inspector to find the xpath...I get no results:.I get {xml_missing}..I obliviously have a lot more to do to generalize this and gather data for all schools, but with web scraping, I usually try to start simple and specific and then broaden out. But even my simple test isn't working. Any ideas?",

Any guidance on how to achieve that would be most appreciated..Edit: One suggestion below was to change facet_wrap(~ state) to facet_wrap(~ state, scales='free') Doing so changes the chart only slightly..I can fix the label anchors, but this really didn't offer the level of differentiation in the line plots I was hoping for..A second suggestion was the change sec.axis = sec_axis(~./100, name=\"Weekly % of Pop Tested\")) to sec.axis = sec_axis(~./1000, name=\"Weekly % of Pop Tested\")).As far as I can tell, that does nothing to the actual plot and just changes the axis markings:..Finally, I've been struggling to implement the solution found here from Dag Hjermann. My secondary axis is the Weekly % of Population Tested, which is represented in the geom_col. A reasonable range for that is 0-1.1. The primary axis is the line plots, test positivity rates, which vary from 0-30. So if I follow that solution, I should add.and then change the plot code to read.and the secondary axis to.Doing so produces the following..which is clearly not right..At the risk of sounding really dumb here, is the issue at least somewhat due to the line plots (what I want to scale) being on the primary axis?",

In my database, I have a table called 'employee' with the columns 'Row_index', 'Address', 'Employee_ID', 'Latitude' and 'Longitude', and a second table called 'red_zones' with the columns 'Location_index', 'Address', 'Latitude' and 'Longitude'..Now I have to match the Lat-Long of each employee in the table 'employee' to the Lat-Long of all containment zones in the table 'red-zones'. I decided to use a stored procedure by iterating through the 'red_zones' table:.After calling the procedure, I got the error 'maximum result count reached, no more results could be displayed'. I figured this was probably because the number of rows in the 'red_zones' table was over 700..So I decided to Iterate through the 'employee' table instead (26 rows):.This procedure did not give me any output at all. I have also made sure that there is a lat-long that matches between the two tables..Should I be looking to modify my procedures, and if so, in what way? Or should I be looking at a completely different method of achieving my goal?.Thanks.",

In this case the confirmed column(here,confirmed is equal to new cases reported in a day plus the preceding day's cases) is arranged in cumulative manner. So to get new cases for each day I have made a subquery and within that query I PARTITIONED it by name and ORDERED it by confirmed(new cases,cumulative) from least to most and then subtracted the preceding row in the current partition. Which would then give me the table in pure new cases per day form. After that in the main query i have GROUPED the table by name(here,name is country) and then selected the groups with at least 1000 cases reported and finally ordered it by date as seen in the expected result..Dont know where i went wrong.

By gradually I mean Item-By-Item if it is difficult to load all at once..I thought after adding the MyAsyncTask class, the app UI won't freeze up, but it does freeze..It might happen that my MyAsyncTask is completely wrong.

  "question_body": "I have 2 heatmaps I'm trying to join together, one contains week over week data and the other contains 6W/YTD information. I keep them separate so their colors aren't skewed..When they're put together in a subplot, the yaxis label on the right is the first row label on the left..I would like to remove that yaxis label, and have tried by means of fig.update_yaxes(title=''/None/False), also the title_text argument, I've also tried accessing it via fig['layout']['scenes']['yaxis2']['title'] = ''/None/False. Seems like a lot of resources (including official documentation) show how to change a single figure, as could be demonstrated with my code via.which unfortunately doesn't carry over when fig2 is added to the subplot. I'm not sure how this assignment is happening. I've reviewed the JSON structure and see no assignment, I've also dug through the structure in their documentation to see if there was something I could override or set. Can someone help me figure out how to hide the fig2 yaxis label? Might be more accurate to ask how one would set this manually, but nonetheless..*edit* I've taken a closer look at the annotations. The figures annotations are set with this bit.these are based on.which are just 2d arrays of integers. checking the annotations in each figure for 'A', the Figure they're added to as subplots is the only one that contains the 'A'.based on that, this could easily be \"solved\" retroactively by overwriting the annotation like so.this works, but feels very finicky and I would still like to know how this is supposed to be done with plotly. This approach feels like it could have unintended effects depending on application..Upon closer inspection I'm also realizing there are no annotations placed on the first 2 columns of the bottom row despite them having annotations in their original figure.I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing or if it's my approach that's incorrect in setting annotations.I'll leave it as is because this post is becoming cumbersome, but there's a problem: 1) with the annotations and 2) the y title for fig2; I feel like they have to be related though I don't know how this is occurring.I've separated my code below, a Paste is available here..imports.data prep.plot_prep.creating and joining the figures",

Here's what I've done so far:.And then I rename the column I need to match a Geojson file:.Because the data was listed by week and I simply need the most up-to-date numbers, I sorted by Zip Code to just get the max values that I was looking for:.So far so good. I drop a few unnecessary rows:.And my dataframe looks like this: Dataframe.I then load a map:.Change the column to type String:.And then I get this error:.KeyError: 'ZIP'.And then load my GeoJson file to layer over it:.Again I get this error: KeyError: \"None of ['ZIP'] are in the columns\".I have tried the code without converting to a string and received the same error code when loading my GeoJson file. I've also tried grouping by different columns with no success. I think the problem is that the \"Zip\" column is the first column and it's header is lower than the others. I think that this likely needs to be addressed for the GeoJson file to work with the data frame, but I cannot figure out how to fix it. Appreciate your input, thanks!",

As such, I simply stop the model from running lest my computer explode into flames..Some IT folks that I know said that they can create an instance in Azure to run these scripts, which would give me significantly more computing power, but they need to know how much CPU and RAM I need. Can anybody help me out with this? I only need to run the model one time, for example to recreate the Oregon chart, rather than all 50 charts as shown on the website.

I have made a basic CNN which is supposed to be trained from the top 1000 word count vector of each tweet which are labelled as positive or negative..Now, the model compiles just fine and I think that the input shape is as per the documentation too i.e (Number of elements, Length of each element)..The problem arises when I try to run the .fit() function..Here I get....I have tried to make different variations which I thought could potentially be the issue but no luck. I don't face any issue in Conv2D which simply takes the shape of a single element as the input_size and the whole features and labels array in the .fit() method. So, what more needs to be done here with Conv1D other than the different input_size format which I have already given.",

  "question_body": "I am working with Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID19 data, published on their GitHub. Some of the metrics they publish in their daily US reports are sum aggregations. I would like to perform basic math against the values within a given field so that I can get a daily tally..JHU publishes their data daily, so let's assume that the numbers reported reflect a 24-hour period..Example: In the State of New York, I can see the following values for Last_Update and Recovered, where Recovered is a rolling sum of all cases where people have recovered from infection:.Ideally, I would like to create a new field (be it a scripted field, or a new field that is generated via a Logstash Filter processor) called RecoveredToday, where the field value reflects the difference between today's Recovered aggregation and yesterday's Recovered aggregation..In the above data set, RecoveredToday is calculated from the value of Recovered on 2020-08-05 minus the value of Recovered on 2020-08-04..With respect to using a Scripted Field in Kibana, according to this blog article, Scripted Fields can only analyze fields within one given document at a time, and cannot perform calculations against a field across multiple documents..I do see user @agung-darmanto solved a similar problem on StackOverflow, but the solution calls out specific dates rather than performing rolling calculations. It's also unclear from the code snippet if the results are being inserted into a new field that can subsequently be used to build visualizations..The approach to use Logstash ruby processing on the fly also presents a problem. Logstash, as far as I know, cannot access an already ingested document ... and if it can, it's probably a pretty ugly superpower to wield..Goal: There are other fields provided in the JHU CSSE data which are also pre-aggregated. I would like to produce visualizations that reflect trends such as:.Using the data they provide, I can build visualizations that will plateau, and that plateau reflects a reduction of incidences. I'm trying to produce visualizations that show ZERO.",

  "question_body": "Part of graph is cropped out when saving.I am trying to combine two separate plots: a first one is a linechart with two unrelated y axis, and is built using base R plot() commands (I read that ggplot2 does not support unrelated secondary y-axis: am I correct?). The second graph is again a linechart, this time with a single y-axis. For the sake of internal consistency, also this graph is built using base R plot() commands..In order to combine the two graphs, I am saving them as two separate objects, using recordPlot(), which I store for combining them in a single column graph using plot_grid() with the parameter ``ncol = 1''. The two graphs taken separately look (almost) as I would like them to be. When I Zoom-in the plotting device, or try to save the combined graph, the bottom axis and part of the upper graph are cropped out..The data for a reproducible example is reported using dput() at the end of the post..Code and system info.The first plot looks fine..The second plot also looks fine:..The problem emerges when I try to combine and export the two graphs as a single column plot_grid() output.In this case, there is a difference in how the combined graph looks like in the plotting device of RStudio, and the output from ggsave() / save_plot(), as I show with the two images below..SUMMARY.I guess my problem might be related to the way I define the margins, but I could not solve this issue. I tryed to play around with par() as well as with the plot_grid() parameters, but I could not solve the discrepancies between what I can see in RStudio and what I get when saving the graph. Do you have any Idea for what is going on? Is it possible that part of the problem relates to the way I build the graph? I would love to use ggplot() rather that plot() (that I think would make it easier to combine plots) but I could not find a way to include an unrelated secondary y-axis. Is there any workaround for this?.DATA",

  "question_body": "I have tried using reprex for the first time to create a reproducible example of my problem so hopefully it works correctly. So i am using two datasets in my ggplot, and i am trying to plot the countries policies above the number of coronavirus cases on the date which it was implemented on. I have chosen to focus on just one country from both the datasets for this example. I have considered trying to join them but there are not an equal amount of countries in both datasets so i am not entirely sure that would work..So the aim is to have the policy names hovering just above the very top of the bar of the date they were implemented on. I believe they are currently in the right positions but i do not know how i can set the y-axis position in the geom text layer because the data for the cases is being used in the first layer..Any advice on how to sort out this problem will be very helpful, thank you..Edit: I plan on scaling this up to all the countries in my dataset, which is roughly 176, so doing it manually is not a realistic approach...Created on 2020-08-13 by the reprex package (v0.3.0)",

I retrieved NYT covid data by county level and statistical data from food agency, so I want to understand how covid cases are surging in counties where major food processing plants are located.

However, I found issues of getting the right plotting data for that because the resulted plot is not getting the expected output. Here is what I tried so far:.my attempt:.Here is the final aggregated covid time series data that I am interested in this gist. Here is my current attempt:.but looks I made the wrong aggregation above, this attempt is not working. My intention is basically if a company has multiple establishments (a.k.a est), then I need to take sum of its num-emp: # of employees, then get the ratio of # of new_deaths / num-emp along the time. Basically I want to track whether company's staff are affected by covid or not with some approximate sense. I am not quite sure what would be the correct way of doing this with matplotlib in python. Can anyone suggest possible of correction to make this right? Any idea?.second attempt.I got some inspiration from recent covid19 related post, so this is another way of trying to do what I want to make in matplotlib. I aggregated data in this way with custom plotting helper function also:.then this is plotting helper function that I came up:.but I trapped again here how to make this right. My essential goal is basically whether how much meat processing companies are affected by covid because if its worker got infected by covid, companies' performance will be dropped. I want to make eda that provides this sort of information visually. Can anyone suggest possible ways of doing this with matplotlib? I am open to any feasible eda attempt that makes this question more realistic or meaningful..desired output.I am thinking about to make eda output something like below:..what I want to see, by county level, how every company's performance is varied because of covid. Can anyone point me out anyway to achieve possible eda output? Thanks.update.since what kind od eda that I want to make is not quite solid in my mind, so I am open to hearing any possible eda that fit the context of the problem that I raised above.

  "question_body": "I have a dataset with the following columns: 'location', 'do i have covid', 'covid symptoms', 'date', 'confirmed_cases'..Essentially, I'm using COVID related queries on Google (which give interest in the query as an integer) to predict the number of cases, across time. Hence, this is a TimeSeries problem..For this, I'm using a Keras RNN model (LSTM). So far, I've filtered the data to just one location, essentially dropping the first 'location' column. However, I now want to visualize my prediction on a map and hence want a location-by-location prediction. For this, I'm thinking of using a multi-input model, as suggested here: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/02/04/keras-multiple-inputs-and-mixed-data/.What I'm struggling with is understanding how this multi-input model would work for my case. This is what I'm thinking so far:.My major concern with this is: would it work the way I intend it to work? I want it to use the location as a 'grouping' feature, in a way. Like, train the model on all of the data but then fine-tune it based on the location. On top of that, what architectures do I use? Here is some pseudo-code with what I envision this to be like and what I'm missing:.If someone could point me in the right direction with some pseudo-code, I would very much appreciate that. Thanks",

However, there has to be a way that a button can display two things when clicked - right?.So, after two days at this - this is where I am at and any suggestions you may have are more than welcomed.

There are about 30 riders per team, and there have been a few dozen races after the sport started up again in July..I'm stumped right now on how to proceed with analyzing the data or if this structure is even the right approach..My end goal is to have a sort of Venn diagram of which riders raced together the most, one for each team, to visualize if they stuck to these bubbles (eg eight riders doing the same six races, and a different group of eight riders doing a different list of races, etc.).Feel free to tag if duplicate/inappropriate etc. But a hand up would be appreciated!.My dataframe looks like such for one team:",

  "question_body": "I have been studying R for a few months. I have been using Covid-19 data from the NYTimes (NY Times Covid Data on Github) as a test data set for learning about statistical programming..From their Github repository, you can get the case data for the US as a whole, by state, or by county. Whichever one you are looking at, there is a cumulative total for the number of known cases and the number of deaths for each location and each date. A location doesn't show up in the data set until there is at least one case or death, and then once there it gets updated every day in perpetuity..My goal is to come up with a way to do calculations for new cases since yesterday, new cases since last week, etc and add these calculations as new columns to my dataframe. I have found a strategy that works with smaller sets of data but gets pretty slow when dealing with nationwide data at the county level..I will generate some random data to use as an example..So first I tried to reverse engineer the cumulative sum. I have not been able to successfully produce what I want..And I needed more flexibility than just figuring out the daily new cases anyway. A lot of the epidemiology models are based on comparing the known cases or deaths today to the known cases or deaths a week ago, or ten days ago, or three weeks ago, or whatever..I built some for loops that worked okay, but the code was clunky and error-prone. And so I came up with this strategy using sapply with the sum function, bracket sub-setting, and binary relational operators. Coming from Excel world, this is basically an approximation of SUMIFS..This works great and I can do all kinds of calculations playing off of this theme. New cases per day, new cases per week, per month. I can calculate a proxy for known active cases by taking the difference between the known cases today and the known cases from n days ago. Subtract the deaths from that and you have a good proxy for known recovered cases in a given area. Substitute the sum function for mean and you can do all kinds of rolling averages. Add some population data and you do it all on a per capita basis. And the subsetting is really powerful for looking at a particular region or metropolitan area or for comparing different locations based on demographic/mobility variables from other data sets. So I am mostly pretty happy with my progress, especially at the national and state levels..However, when you start getting down to the county level it gets pretty slow as the datasets get pretty huge. Did you know there are 254 counties in Texas alone? And a lot of times the daily updates revise past numbers. Obviously, I can just schedule it to run over night or split the data up into smaller chunks, etc. But I'm interested mostly just to understand the mechanics of wrangling huge time series datasets efficiently..So TLDR; is there a computationally faster method to do these calculations in a dataset with millions of rows?.And as secondary questions, people often mention data.table for very large datasets, would this be a good application for that package and what would the syntax look like? I haven't figured out how to do it without relying on the same sapply trick and then it's probably not any faster. Or are there time-series packages for R that do this kind of thing well already whose code I could examine for pointers?.Thank you.If it matters, I'm running RStudio 4.0.2 on Windows10. And I do most of my wrangling with base R and dplyr.",

  "question_body": "I'm working in an external validation project and I have some doubts regarding testing the calibration of a model. My project regards validation of Community Acquired Pneumonia Scores in a Retrospective Cohort, however, for this question, I will create a simulated data-set..Suppose I have 3 predictor variables (hemoglobin, creatinine and sex) which are continuous, continuous and binary respectively and the outcome is death which is also binary outcome..And suppose there is a model out there that says that points for hemoglobin, creatinine and sex to predict death. It assigns 1 point if male, 2 points if hemoglobin less or equal to 12 and 3 points if creatinine greater or equal to 1. I then calculate the respective score in R and will have the outcome in numbers from 0 to 6 maximum. I have the also the outcome of those patients, however, I have a scale in points and not probabilities. How can I test the calibration of this model?.The simplest way that comes to my mind is fitting it a logistic model (eg. glm(data = outcome, death ~ score)) and then using for example the function calibrate from rms package to plot it. However, I'm concerned that fitting a logistic regression model would 'train' and overfitt the model to my data (slope would be 1 and intercept 0). A second way of doing that would be going after the original paper where they validated the score and getting their predicted death rates by each level of score. However, I dont think people would actually do that..Here goes the code..To make things easier for understanding, my problem is validating the PSI (Pneumonia Severity Assessment) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients.

I seem to be experiencing the same problem as the poor soul in this thread: https://forums.iis.net/t/1240175.aspx..NOTE: I posted this earlier today on Superuser - I realized there is a large base of IIS-tagged questions on SO so thought I'd also post here..OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit 2004 19041.508.Problem: Basically, IIS will not serve static content over a certain arbitrary size - static files over that size will just timeout eventually. Non-static content, for example asp files do not have this limit and load as expected regardless of size. This started happening seemingly out of nowhere with no directly related IIS/system/network/permission changes..Things I've Tried:.Details:.About a 1 or 1.5 months ago my local IIS stopped working, out of the blue. By out of the blue I mean the the previous day it was working fine as always and the next it stopped - without having done any system changes whatsoever. By stopped working I mean (eventually realized) that it was only static files that were not serving correctly. Unfortunately/fortunately, I noticed the problem because I had created the obligatory personal COVID tracker. It was html/js running against a .NET API back end. The pages stopped loading and I spent time wondering what I had borked in the code (which I also hadn't touched). Eventually I realized no static content - images, css, js, html, txt etc. - was loading properly. I ran some tests and I found that there was a cutoff point in size of content that would load, but it is somewhat arbitrary. For example, the iisstart.png image in the default IIS website does not load - it's 97K. I replaced it with an 8k file that loads fine. I could get about 1500 bytes served in an html file - 1501 bytes would send it off the rails but 1500 worked. Same sort of thing was found for text files although I was able to send more than 1500 bytes - don't remember how much but did find a point where a 1 byte difference caused a problem..Test Load of Default IIS Website:.IIS log is not helpful - it reports the failed attempt as a 200 but says it took 19 seconds. It is returning a win32 status code of 121 though:.The tracing mostly doesn't fire I guess because the 200 is eventually returned?.Fiddler gives me this for the image request:.For this site the actual html loads fine - it's only 696 bytes - the image it references does not though (97K)..If anybody can shed some light on this or give me a direction in troubleshooting I would greatly appreciate it..Thanks",

I will place the code that I believe caused this issue, but I would recommend against running it unless you know how to fix it.

Just to name a quick few, resetting using sns.set(), sns.set_style(), sns.restore_defaults(). I have also tried resetting matplot settings to defaults as well. This attribute persists across all my files, so I cant even open a new file, delete the line of code that caused it, or run any past programs, or it will apply to those graphs too. My seaborn version is 0.10.1, I have tried to update it, but I cant get it to go through. I am using anaconda's spyder IDE The documentation says for versions after 0.8 that the styles/themes must be invoked to be reset, but if I try to use their solution sns.set_theme() I get an error saying that this module has no attribute.

I have created an example dataset of what one policies values might look like for one country. If the policies value is 0, then there is no active policy. The policy is active if it ranges from 1-5 and the scale of the policy increases as it gets larger..So the problem i had was i wanted to subset all the start and end dates of the policies so i could later plot them as labels. I managed to accomplish this using a column with lagged values and one with lead values. Using these, i was able to detect when a policy \"turned on\" by checking if the previous value was any value other than the policy value. I did the same for the policy end but with the lead value this time..My question is simply that i wanted to know if anyone knew of a more efficient way of doing this, Thank you..Edit: Changed some variable names and added in the output for the label policy start/end variables..Created on 2020-09-16 by the reprex package (v0.3.0)",

I tail the last 20 lines and then grep \"World\". I do this because if I simply grep \"World\", it only return the title line where \"World\" can also be found. So my second question is: How can I grep only the last or second occurance?",

When I run it I get something like this..And using the scrapy shell to check if its getting links, I get this.Any help or insight would be much appreciated. And if you're willing to help with another problem, I'm looking for a solution to store all of the charts I collect into multiple csv or xlsx files. Thanks!",

I left it over night and still I never got the \"Data successfully loaded\". When I did a smaller dataset ~100 lines, it seemed to work but the full dataset, it would just sit there after a certain line like it might be waiting for something? I would print each row just as an indication that it was still doing something ( I know it adds time, I plan to remove, just a visual indication of what's happening)..I changed one of the lines to:.so that it wouldn't stop at line 1000 or whatever it was and now it has read the entire file after 5 HOURS, but looks the same as it did when it read the first 1000 lines. Like its waiting for something or still thinking (provided a screenshot)?

  "question_body": "I've been trying to just extract and scrape the number of COVID cases off of a website and display them on an index.html page, using puppeteer to scrape the data from the official COVID website. I have this code for my API in my index.js file:.The function \"scrapeCases\" is in a file called scrapers.js in the same directory as index.js. It returns the jsonValue() of the number I'm trying to extract from the COVID website (number of cases), which in reality gives me a Promise return value, which is why I also used toString() to change that..When I do console.log(myFinal) as given, the proper number of cases is shown in the terminal as if it were a regular string. But when I do res.send(myFinal), it doesn't show up in my index.html page, but if I comment res.send(myFinal) and do res.send('6') as an arbitrary example, the 6 is displayed (after a short delay of time, not sure why). Why is it that it doesn't work with res.send?.Also, if I do this instead:.Here I add \"await\" to my func.ScrapeCases statement since I think this is another way I can get the value of the Promise of numC. Again, the console.log(myFinal) gives me the proper amount of cases as a simple number with commas in between (e.g. 1,366,234), and res.send('6') again displays on my index.html if I uncomment it, but res.send(myFinal) does not display anything..Any help is appreciated thank you!",

Of course, I have not had any classes in R, so this kind of a \"throw him in the pool so he learns to swim\" situation..So I looked up some tutorials, but I just can't figure this out: I only have to compare the first half of each year (2017-2020), but I just don't know how I can eliminate everything that is not within that time from my dataframe.

  "question_body": "I'm looking for some direction on a simple people counter webapp that I need for an event at a non-profit next month. The idea is that for Covid, the venue is limiting the number of attendees. I'd like to have two helpers at either door with a web browser on their Smart Phones. One counts people coming in and the other counts them going out. The number displayed would be updated in real time as the other presses..My original thought was as simple as the count and a big green circle to increment, and a red circle to decrement..This needs to be a real time application with some kind of back end. I was thinking of using node.js and perhaps some kind of service like Pusher, but I'm looking for suggestions..Does an something like this already exist or do any of you know of an example project that could easily be modified to turn this into a People Counter? While I'm an engineer, I know just enough about Javascript to be dangerous and it seems like I forget everything in between using it. Thanks, Chris",

My current project is a twitter bot that scrapes a government website for the latest COVID-19 case counts in my jurisdiction and tweets them out, building off this awesome tutorial..Functionally it is working, but I want to finesse it so that it only posts when that data is updated and new. Otherwise, it’s just an account that posts the same information every day rather than a news account..I thought the built-in rules in the Twitter API that don’t allow duplicate tweets would work automatically to filter out old information. Sometimes it does work, but the rule isn’t strict enough- it appears the account can still post duplicates as long as it doesn’t do it too often. Ideally, I’d like to make it more strict in my code. It would need to compare the new text to the last tweet, and only tweet if there was a difference in the text..Can anyone give me some guidance on if this is possible, and how best to get it done?

I already have the datas of how those population has changed since the beginning of the pandemic. But I want to modelize the evolution of those population to find some parameters like rates of infection or rates at which each population change from one population to another. The modelling led me to a system of 6 coupled differential equations , one for the temporal evolution of each population (dS/dt , dE/dt , ... , dR/dt) in which there is every parameters I want to find..system of coupled differential equation.So , I have this mathematical model with a lot of unknown parameters that I want to find. To do so , I would like to do a curvefit with the function scipy.optimize.curve_fit to find the correct parameters. But the problem I have is that I need those parameters to solve numerically those differential equations. Is there a way to do a curve_fit to find the parameters that create the solutions to the differential equation system that fit the best the datas I already have for those 6 populations?.I'm missing how to merge curvefiting and resolving system of coupled differential equations....Thanks a lot !",

  "question_body": "PROBLEM: After rendering a certain video with ffmpeg file size increased from 4GB to 6GB.\nORIGINAL VIDEO: EE1.mkv\nFFMPEG COMMAND: ffmpeg -i EE1.mkv -c:a copy -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -profile:v high out.mp4\nQUESTIONS: Why did the file size increase? What am I doing wrong?.!DETAILS!\nAfter a few years I made about 30 gaming videos (130GB) and with the current covid-19 situation I started recording my online classes (about 40 videos or 150GB). Now because I'm lacking space on my 1TB external HDD I started getting into ffmpeg. Before I was only using obs-studio and not good parameters for recording..I was using CBR mode for recording, either 5000KB or 15000KB bit rate with varying x264 presets and profiles because I was also experimenting with them. Usually superfast preset with high profile. So I wanted to convert all those videos with ffmpeg using CRF 23, medium preset and high profile. A note that when I'm recording with obs-studio it's set to record in matroska format (.mkv)..When I was rendering my online classes videos with these settings I managed to achieve 10x better compression with the same quality. And when rendering my gaming videos I managed to achieve up to 3x better compression with the same quality. However there is this one video that when rendered with the same parameters the file size increases..The EE1.mkv should be recorded with CBR 15000KB bit rate, with superfast preset and high profile. Also the game that is recorded in this video is Empire Earth which needs around 8000KB for it to look good. Everything more than 8000KB is not needed..Thank you all for your help.",

I'll need to call the API for both web and console apps, so it will be used a lot..I obviously don't want to call it using plaintext in the app(s) (them)selves because I don't want the credentials stored in version control. I also don't want to use Secret Manager or Environment Variables, because these apps will be used in production..The only thing I can think of is storing the username/password (as plaintext) somewhere on the server and letting Windows Authentication handle the security of the data..Is that a good practice though? I mean I guess it's as secure as the server is and if someone got access into the server we'd have bigger problems, but it just seems like it isn't good practice..Also, I know Azure Key Vault would be ideal in this scenario, but the company is going through a lot of transitions and finances are up in the air with covid - so we're trying to minimize costs as much as possible for the time being..Any one have any input?",

The 36 images were of 6 different people showing 6 different emotions.

  "question_body": "I'm an amateur user of MS Access to create some databases for work. I'm currently trying to make a database to track people that are in quarantine due to potential exposure to COVID-19. I have the input stuff down but I need help with tallying up the numbers to get the output that we need. I can't access this site at work and I'm working off of memory at home so please bear with me. The part where I'm consistently getting errors is with a line similar to:.TallyRecordset![Contractor Pos not Hos] = 0.I'm getting an error that I think is saying that its not defined but again I'm going off of memory and I think it was error 3021. I've tried coming at this from several different ways already using nesting if/then statements (because the above would look a contractor that had tested positive but was not hospitalized so its not a straight count) and having the tally go directly to the table that I made for tallies with the fields as numbers and it didn't work. So then I thought that creating an integer variable and making those equal to the fields in the table that I changed to strings would fix the issue but I got the same error. After googling the problem for a couple of days and getting no solutions that make sense to me I'm not even sure that I'm going about this the right way. I'm guessing that I have to do something with queries but I have no idea. Thanks for taking the time to read this and for any input that you have..Edit: The error that I get is:.Run-time error '3021': No current record.. It highlights the line:.CountRecordset.Edit.I'm trying to get an output that is easy to copy and paste into a table in PowerPoint for a slide.",

  "question_body": "I have a scraper in python that runs daily to collect numbers of new covid cases, but the problem is that the source website sometimes shows the numbers of the previous day. Whenever this happens, I want the python script to send me an email. The email has to be sent from python because there I evaluate if the collected values are the same as the previous day..The scraper runs daily on GitHub Actions and I need to pass the sender email credentials to the python script, for which I plan to use GitHub secrets. Sender email account is @gmail.com.I have successfully ran the script locally, storing email credentials as environment variables..What I've tried so far: I'm trying to mimic the approach explained by user Simran-B here. I created two secrets in the repo: EMAIL_ADDRESS and EMAIL_PASSWORD. I need to use these secrets inside the python script and this is the part I'm missing..The .yml file in folder .github/workflows has these lines:.The .py script is called sj-gobierno.py and has the following lines:.In both chunks above I'm skipping other lines in the sake of brevity. I guess the problem is in the chunks above: the workflow was running successfully on GH Actions before I added the send-email feature. The current status of the workflow is 'failing'.

  "question_body": "I came to you as I went through all similar discussions and could not find an answer.\nAll referenced files can be found on my Github at this address..I am running a Python simple script on a free EC2 instance on AWS, which is supposed to fill a form (it is actually the french covid attestation forms) and download it with some data taken from a JSON file (in the config folder)..This project was more of a pretext to use a distant VM and see how it would work out. I have installed all necessary tools as on my host machine in the VM, especially Python 3.8, Selenium, ChromeDriver and Google Chrome (the configuration file is called scripts/configure.sh)..The main (and only script) src/main.py works well on my local machine, as it fills the form and downloads it in a specific folder. But it seems that on the VM, the download does not happen..The options I have put so far for my webdriver are :.I also have set all directories to chmod 777 in case it is a permission problem, as I saw it could be a common thing.\nI have no errors, which mean it succeeds to perform all form fillings (I was first thinking about a the final form not being complete). I also tried to locate the downloaded file somewhere, but it is nowhere to be found.\nFinally, I also tried it interactively with a terminal console locally, and it also works fine..It worked at some point ! First only at once, and then all the times with embedded arguments instead of JSON files. So to use it on my phone and share it with friends, I just added the fact that my python script takes the information to fill as an input :.So it could be that python WebElement.sendKeys(...) works differently now ? I have tried to back up but could not make it work again, it has to come from the VM config somehow but I also tried to reboot the VM or to create a new one and it still did not work..So if any of you ran into the same problem and found a magical solution for this problem, I'd be happy to know !",

  "question_body": "I create a lot of instructional videos for my job. Some of them have me talking for 30+ min. while recording my screen as I demonstrate something. So I end up with dozens and dozens of .mp4 video files. I've recently been asked to create a transcript of each video that can be used as a \"closed caption\" to satisfy the ADA (American Disabilities Act) for the hearing impaired. I looked into pretty much every commercially available transcription solution to see about having all these videos transcribed. I've also looked into all seven of the open-source or free solutions like Google's Cloud Speech, IBM Watson's speech recognition... etc. and to quickly get to the point... all the commercially available solutions (DeScript, Audiate) all carry a fee (naturally). The company I work for has been hit by COVID pretty hard, so we are on total lockdown for new purchases and licenses. All the free and open source services only allow really small files that my 30 min. long videos dwarf. So I set out to see about creating a solution using Python. I found the SpeechRecognition package... and that lead me to find Carnegie Mellon's Pocketsphinx open source speech recognition toolkit. I was elated when I was able to get it all working, and I ran my first Transcription, and it worked!!! I did have to convert the .mp4 to a .wav file for it to work. And... the transcription isn't really all that great. If you think Siri's \"talk to text\" service makes mistakes... the transcript that resulted from my .WAV transcription was very... in the ballpark... but not perfect by any means. But, hey... I'll take it. It is a whole lot easier to scan and fix a .txt transcript than it is to sit and literally dictate it by hand..My question is... the transcripts that result from the Pocketsphinx solution have no capitalization, punctuation, or any sense of grammer. They are just a flat-out .txt file with a bunch of words that I have to go back and add punctuation too..Can any of you maybe point me in the direction of some way to either improve the transcription, or reprocess the resulting .txt file to insert some basic punctuation? I am barely literate with Python, so everything I've read online that has invoked concepts like machine learning and AI, are all way over my head. Should I just be happy with what I've been able to get?",

  "question_body": "We are using Google's Custom Search JSON API for higher-education research, where we essentially are parsing through a large amount of URLs to find information on various organizations' responses to COVID-19. We are using Google's API to find top search results. However, we have found that there are inconsistent results when using different search parameters within the API query. The inconsistencies are an issue because we are trying to hone our query to a certain error rate (error rate being how many URLs provide effective research information). We are looking for someone to help explain how Google's API works, because the documentation is extremely minimal. An example of our base query: 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=KEY&cx=SEARCHENGINE&q=\"School Name\" intext:(term1 | term2 | term3) -inurl:(unwanted1 | unwanted2 | unwanted3) inurl:(wanted1 | wanted2 | wanted3)&start=1'.Where \"School Name\" is the name of a higher-ed institution. Term1, term2, etc., are specific variables that we want to find in the body text of the search results. The intext parameter helps to avoid invisible text in certain documents. For example, insidehighered.com includes many higher-ed institutions in invisible text without the actual article being applicable. Unwanted 1, etc,. are words or phrases that we don't want included in the URL title. For example, we want to avoid PDF documents, so one could be \".pdf\". Wanted1, etc,. are words that we do want in the URL, like \"news\". We use \"|\" to signify \"or\", which allows us to utilize one query for multiple types of searches, thus helping to minimize the cost of our API usage..So far, we've found the following issues/inconsistencies:.Our code being used to pull the items off of each page is:.Thank you!",

  "question_body": "I inherited an apache web server setup with another VM running apache just to act as a firewall. After some digging around I thought I understood how it worked:.VM-webfirewall IP = xxx.xx.xx.xxx our outside ip address VM-web-server IP = 10.1.1.72 our inside IP address..Webfirewall seems to run apache and has an /etc/httpd/sites-enabled folder with conf files for each of our internal websites like:.weather.abc.com database.abc.com which is all from our www.abc.com.now it has two conf files the second one always ending in -ssl.conf.So an example of two conf files:.flower.conf.then.flower-ssl.conf.So these work great! The request comes in, it goes off to our flower database and boom right away if you are offsite asks for a user name and password..This is on our web-firewall VM, now on our actual web -server VM there is another apache running with a similar /etc/httpd/sites-enabled folder. This also has a conf file:.002-flower.conf.So if you are onsite, you can just goto flower.abc.com and boom the app (it is a flask based app behind nginx running on a complete VM by itself. The VM ip address of 10.10.1.152 is the IP for this web-server itself..So all this to say the above works great!, so I thought I would mimic this for my little covid19 tracking app written in Django..I have the raspberry pi on the network setup, and running django uWSGI behind NGINX. This raspberry pie has a dns entry of webserver2 and also works totally fine, when on site on my work network I can goto:.covid19.abc.com and it comes up fine. I can also goto webserver2.abc.com:8080 and it comes up fine..When I am off site (not on the work network), I get the:.If I look from the web-firewall (where I believe a request should first come in) there is no entry in the access_log of anyone even trying to hit the sight. I can hit other ones like weather.abc.com and it shows the entries from my IP etc. So it is like it is not even making it to the apache portion on the web-firewall for any requests for the covid19.abc.com website. I am not sure where else to look..The conf files on the webfirewall for my covid site are: (I don't need that authentication portion if you are offsite/network so I didn't add that)..site-covid19.conf.site-covid19-ssl.conf.Then on the webserver the config is:.000-site-covid19.conf.Though again I get that error from the browser and nothing in the only log I know to check (/etc/httpd/access_log) Is there somewhere else to look or test to even see if apache is picking up the request to covid19.abc.com (works when VPNed or on site itself) just not when off site..(I realize I am asking for certs and I know since I don't have any yet the browser should just bark at me and I can accept and move on...but wanted to get the 'basic' part done first). I am just out of ideas on what to try or look for next..Since I know the django app is working and running, and I also copied the configs for another website that was running and working I am at a loss as to why it doesn't work at all. I wish I even got an error as to why but nothing. I can grep log files on both servers for covid19 and it never shows like a request even came in for that or anything.",

  "question_body": "Good morning :).I have some questions regarding an icecast-setup. We have my own (Nextcloud)-Server sitting in our church. This works perfectly fine and since here in Germany the community services got forbidden already once during all this Covid19-stuff, we want to have a stream-setup. I managed to set up an icecast-instance on our server and we use my old laptop with Rocket Broadcaster and a Steinberg CI2 to provide the source for the stream. That works all as intended. We already used it once because we stopped public services for two weeks after one of our member got tested positive after he went abroad for a week. Our operator on the PA doesn't want to have another display there, which would disturb him from listening the sermon..My project regarding this: I have a RPi4 and a Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD. The input atm is a standard mic, that is connected to the Interface. The Pi is configured with darkice and uses its own icecast installation, while I am testing everything at home. Since I started the streaming project, after the service we switched Rocket Broadcaster to use VLC and a folder of old service recordings (mastered and in MP3-format) to provide a source to listen while we are at work or on travels. This option gets used pretty regularly and I want to keep it going. My plan is to have a little box with a LED levelmeter, where the input level is shown. That should be done with a little python script. Also I want to add two buttons, where presets for the two setups get loaded. Button 1: kill the current source and start the darkice livestream. Button 2: kill the current source and start the playback of old recordings. Both options should have visual feedback for the operator. The raspberry has to work in headless mode without need for a VNC or SSH-connection for the normal usage..My problem: I tried: sudo killall darkice && /home/pi/darkice.sh.This code will get changed, because I probably have to use ices for the mp3-playback. So basically it kills darkice, starts the ices playback (for now only restarts the stream in a blink) and vice versa. The bash-file exists and gets executed at reboot via cronjob. That works well. When I execute the above mentioned killall command, icecast continues the broadcast almost instantly, but the stream stops on the clients. Everyone needs to restart it. Do I have an option to change the setup, so that I am able to switch between the two options without the need for everyone to restart? My plan was to create a bash-script, where I do this all inside and execute it via GPIO-input and pythoncode..Thanks in advance!",

So here's the problem:.I am working on a COVID19 project to visualize the spread of the virus across the world. I have a choropleth map of the world that uses a date slider to update the map with the number of cases and deaths by country. I have a button that updates the map by adjusting the metrics by population..I have created two sets of color/bin/palette controls for the map based on whether or not the data is adjusted for population. When the data is not adjusted, the colors on the map seem to correlate appropriately to the bin color categories, but when I adjust for population, the colors do not seem to update with the new bin color categories. They seem to correlate with the first bin color categories..For example, when I want to look at cumulative cases and cumulative deaths adjusted for population, the numbers are much smaller, but the new color palette is still associated with the original color palette (for non-adjusted metrics), so it looks like there's no data/extremely low counts..//Ignore the missing countries in the map//.I figure the issue lies somewhere with the pal3 and pal4 arguments not being recognized. Can someone explain why these arguments are being ignored? Or is it another issue that I'm missing?.Here is my code:...As you can see in the 2nd picture, the color for Brazil should be a dark orange.",

  "question_body": "Scenario: An asynchronous session is used within a Class to access an off-line server.\nThere are several endpoints that are accessed via a class enum per context of the request from the container view.\nThe data accumulates in a Singleton class amongst other endpoints for quicker access via member views..One member view is displayed per endpoint..Goal: to notify the parent View after the requested endpoint has returned data for display; which in turn populates a particular member view...Problem: Needless to say, the member view is always rendered before receiving the data.\nThat is, it's out-of-sync..In fact, the only way to have the data seen is via a button on the container view to display the member view with the data on demand. This is NOT what I want. I want this to happen automatically upon data-source selection..My Solution: to fire off a Notification to the container view once data is available so the container view can render the appropriate member view with the data..Problem: I'm using the publisher-subscribe scenario to wait for notification so I can display the data.\nBut I'm confused at handling the subscriber within the container view..I was thinking of using the **NSNotification** use of a handler @Objc function vs publish/subscribe.\nBut I'm mixing imperative with the subjective paradigm here..The following piece of code posts the notification upon receiving data:.The following code snippet is within a function of a View to handle the Notification.\nThis isn't firing..Question: should I pass a publisher variable between the class & the container view from which to launch the subscriber?.I understand the cause/affect of using @State <--> @Binding in synchronous time.\nBut I need the have the view react asynchronously upon the conclusion of acquiring the server data..I'm not sure I can use the conventional NSNotification within the container view..The bottom line: can I get the container view to react to the end of the network session?",

  "question_body": "I'm creating a report in R that estimates and plots the level of transmission of COVID19, and am finding that it runs MUCH more slowly in R Markdown than it does in the Console. I am using RStudio for Mac v1.3.1093, and R v4.0.3..This chart, which uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to estimate infections and the level of spread, first obtains data showing new cases by day in the American state of Oklahoma. This is very quick in both the Console and R Markdown. The next part is the MCMC modelling, which is where the delays are coming..I ran it this morning and it took 2.5 hours in R Markdown, compared to 30 minutes when running the query as an R Script in the Console..I can't work out why it's SO much slower in the R Markdown version. This becomes more important because, if I run the query at a county level (say, for 10 counties), then it models this 10 times, and would therefore take 10 times longer..As a shortcut, I can simply run 2 queries, with the output of the modelling query being added into a bigger R Markdown query (e.g., by saving/reading in an RDS file).

  "question_body": "So I am relatively new to python and am having issues getting my data sorted/displayed like I need. Background - I am doing a project using Bing Coronavirus related searches by country over a year time frame (daily entries), along with covid case rates/death rates, and performing some aspects of NLP to try and see if there are patterns in search terms the correspond to a rise or fall in case numbers..So this is where I am right now: The Bing Search dataset and the covid case rates/death rates dataset have been joined by country. The resulting dataset has been loaded into a jupyter notebook and the search phrases have been tokenized to break them up into single words. I have used the FreqDist function to find the most common words in the dataset. What I would like to be able to graph is the most common word by country. I've been unable to figure out how to show both the most common words and then additional variables.

  "question_body": "I am slightly new to PostgreSQL and had a doubt..Suppose I have a table with data like this (below). How do I select ten rows from each of the classes (or sentiments), i.e. 10 positive tweets, 10 extremely positive tweets, 10 negative tweets, etc. (there are around 11 such classes)? The data is also somewhat large to do manually; ~1k rows..As the title reads, my actual goal is to make a 10:90 split in the entire table and add another column with a test-train label, while keeping the class balance intact. So, if there is any other better way to do this, please suggest..(I do realise that python could make life easier, but I wish to know if we can do it with SQL directly, also kinda constrained to SQL at the moment.)",

  "question_body": "I’m currently trying to train a Spanish to English model using yaml scripts. My data set is pretty big but just for starters, I’m trying to get a 10,000 training set and 1000-2000 validation set working well first. However, after trying for days, I think I need help considering that my validation accuracy goes down the more I train while my training accuracy goes up..My data comes from the ES-EN coronavirus commentary data set from ModelFront found here https://console.modelfront.com/#/evaluations/5e86e34597c1790017d4050a. I found the parallel sentences to be pretty accurate. And I’m using the first 10,000 parallel lines from the dataset, skipping sentences that contain any digits. I then take the next 1000 or 2000 for my validation set and the next 1000 for my test set, only containing sentences without numbers. Upon looking at the data, it looks clean and the sentences are lined up with each other in the respective lines..I then use sentencepiece to build a vocabulary model. Using the spm_train command, I feed in my English and Spanish training set, comma separated in the argument, and output a single esen.model. In addition, I chose to use unigrams and a vocab size of 16000.As for my yaml configuration file: here is what I specify.My source and target training data (the 10,000 I extracted for English and Spanish with “sentencepiece” in the transforms []).My source and target validation data (2,000 for English and Spanish with “sentencepiece” in the transforms []).My vocab model esen.model for both my Src and target vocab model.Encoder: rnn Decoder: rnn Type: LSTM Layers: 2 bidir: true.Optim: Adam Learning rate: 0.001.Training steps: 5000 Valid steps: 1000.Other logging data..Upon starting the training with onmt_translate, my training accuracy starts off at 7.65 and goes into the low 70s by the time 5000 steps are over. But, in that time frame, my validation accuracy goes from 24 to 19..I then use bleu to score my test set, which gets a BP of ~0.67..I noticed that after trying sgd with a learning rate of 1, my validation accuracy kept increasing, but the perplexity started going back up at the end..I’m wondering if I’m doing anything wrong that would make my validation accuracy go down while my training accuracy goes up? Do I just need to train more? Can anyone recommend anything else to improve this model? I’ve been staring at it for a few days. Anything is appreciated. Thanks..!spm_train --input=data/spanish_train,data/english_train --model_prefix=data/esen --character_coverage=1 --vocab_size=16000 --model_type=unigram.onmt_build_vocab -config en-sp.yaml -n_sample -1.onmt_train -config en-sp.yaml",

This application has a flag whether or not the owner of the device is covid infected at the moment. The user can change this. Now, let's assume a group of people having this same application..My question is - is it possible for all devices to perform a scan every once a while to detect whether somebody in their close range was covid infected and send them a warning?.In my mind, the best possible scenario is to simply send a data over bluetooth everytime a bluetooth scan is performed, whitelisting the application as an auto-pair somehow (don't know if it's possible) and sharing user data (covid sick flag). However it seems like this is not possible, and instead the other way would be to perform the scan, save all MAC addresses of nearby devices and once internet connection is available, check the MAC addresses server-side for covid possibility..Is this possible? Are there other ways?",

The data is time series so it is more likely that number of positive cases in random sample of groups will be from different point of time.

My question is, there are two ways Im thinking of doing this:.Option 1:.We put the logic like above into the database and have every metric be it's own column..Option 2:.I setup the fact table like so:.And then create a dimension table like so:.The tables that I have currently (in the format of the first table) each are around 200k rows and there are 4 of them.

The problem arises while working with Observations..Observations. Point. Pfizer is 98% effective. Point. Moderna is 97% effective..If we Split the above text with Split('.'). we get something like ['observations', 'point', 'pfizer is 98% effective', 'point', 'moderna is 97% effective'].Which when given in out function above to make a dictionary gives us {'heading': 'covid test 2', 'hypothesis': 'vaccine still works', 'observations': 'point'} because we are splitting it on period (.).So I was wondering if there is a method to split the texts on the base of keywords in our list?

Save\".And it splits the above text on keyword_list = ['heading', 'hypothesis', 'observations', 'save'].giving us something like {'heading': 'covid test 2', 'hypothesis': 'vaccine still works', 'observations': 'Point. Pfizer is 98% effective. Point. Moderna is 97% effective.',  'save': ''}",

Create an empty ./test/__init__.py and the following two files:.Running test/real_test.py does the expected, failing a test. Now pip install dash==1.19.0 and the test fails to run with.Running pytest --import-mode=importlib test/real_test.py (found in the comments of https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7408) gives me a little hint that it isn't including the cwd in the path used to search for libraries because it is looking at a test in the pyenv, not in the cwd..Mysteriously to me after running pip uninstall dash the test runs as expected with pytest test/real_test.py but is still broken with pytest --import-mode=importlib test/real_test.py..I suspect moving our tests from test/ to tests/ will fix this but I'd like to understand why installing dash breaks things and if our current setup is a problem, help other people avoid it..(I posted this at https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/discussions/8270 too and hoping for more response on stack overflow.)",

  "question_body": "My graduation project is to use transfer learning on a CNN model that can diagnose Covid-19 from Chest X-ray images. After spending days Fine tuning the hyper parameters such as the number of fully connected layers, the number of nodes in the layers, the learning rate, and the drop rate using Keras tuner library with Bayesian Optimizer, I got some very good results, A test accuracy of 98% for multi class classification and a 99% for binary class classification. However, i froze all the layers in the original base model. I only fine tuned the last Fully connected layers after exhaustive hyper parameter optimization. Most articles and papers out there say that they fine the fully connected layers as well as some of the convolutional layers. Am i doing something wrong? I am afraid that this is too good to be true..My data set is not that big, only 7000 images taken from the Kaggle Covid-19 competition..I used image enhancement techniques such as N-CLAHE on the images before the training and the classification which improved the accuracy significantly compared to not enhancing the images..I did the same for multiple State of art models, such as VGG-16 and ResNet50, and they all gave me superb results.",

  "question_body": "My final year project involves predicting covid-19 daily cases while considering exogenous factors (population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Median Age, Diabetes Prevalence, Human Development Index (HDI), Air Pollution as Particulate matter level (PM2.5))..I was learning about the NARX Neural Network model, but mostly the researches, tutorial videos I have come through have used exogenous inputs that are dynamic or have a time series element. But, for my research I have planned to use static exogenous inputs which are for the year 2019..This means that I have an annual data by country for these exogenous input data where each country will have only one value for the input. On the other hand, my target data which is covid-19 cases is a daily data. Therefore, I am facing difficulty on how to implement the NARX model for such case..I managed to find a similar research that has done this but the research didn't really explain how the model is implemented. Therefore, I would like to know whether can exogenous inputs for NARX Neural Network Model be an annual data and the target be a daily data? and can it be implemented in matlab R2021a using GUI or the ntstool?",

I am struggling to plot to time series data by cluster. I would like there to be one plot per cluster with each plot showing the time series data for the FIP codes assigned to the cluster being plotted. I clustered using TS Learn's TimeSeriesKmeans with Euclidean Distance, I am not sure it matters what package I used for clustering. The example code I was given for plotting has it's starting data as a series, where I am starting from a data frame - I think this where the problem starts. I don't think I am calling to the right elements when trying to plot. For my data frame each column a different FIPS code, the index is a datetime index (freq = day), and as a I mentioned each value is the number of Covid cases per day (the data frame has been smoothed and scaled appropriately)..X1: is a toy data set from my data, with.X = the transpose the values of the df, which is what I cluster.y_pred = clusters assigned to each FIPS code.[OUT]:is what is happening.As you can see nothing prints in the plot.

Can I still use Cronbach alpha and use the raw alpha for each parameter? Is there something else that's more appropriate?",

I am also extracting the total numbers for the state, but the producers of the PDF cannot decide if they want to call that row of data \"Gesamt\" (\"Total\") or \"Gesamtergebnis\" (\"Total result\"). The dataframe I am working with, after camelot extracts the table from the PDF, looks like this:.The code below works, if they use \"Gesamt.\" I would like to write it so that it will also work if they use \"Gesamtergebnis.\" I cannot rely on the total (\"Gesamt\" or \"Gesamtergebnis\") always being in the same row..How can I use a regular expression to match either \"Gesamt\" or \"Gesamtergebnis\" in the variable passed to the lambda expressions 'landindexyes' and 'landindexdbf'?.If regular expressions are not the way to go, I am open to other suggestions. I am thinking that an if/else might work, but I don't think that would be as elegant.",

  "question_body": "I tried to download data on covid provided by the Economist's Github repository..What I get is a tibble data frame and I am unable to easily access the data stored in that tibble. I would like to look at one column, say test$covid_deaths_per_100k and re-shape that into a matrix or ts object with rows referring to time and columns referring to countries..I tried it manually, but I failed. Then I tried with the tsibble package and failed again:.So, I guess the problem is that the data are stacked by countries and hence the time index is duplicated. I would need some of these magic pipe functions to make this work? Is there an easy way to do that, perhaps without piping?",

Residuals are not normally distributed, autocorrelation persists, and the residuals are heteroscedastic.

  "question_body": "I am currently trying to apply the hampel filter to my dataframe in python, I have looked around and there isn't a lot of documentation for its implementation in python. I found one post but it looks like it was created before there was an actual hampel package/function and someone created a function to do a rolling mean calculation not using the filter from the package itself, even the site for Hampel the package is minimal. I am looking at the number of Covid cases per day by fips code. I have 470 time series (in days) data frame, each column is a different FIPS code and each row has the number of Covid cases per day (with dates, not the day number from start). The package for Hampel is very straight forward, it has two options for outputs, it will either return a list of the indices where it thinks there are outliers or it will replace the outliers with the median with in the data..[IN]:.[IN]: # to return indices:.[OUT]:.[IN]: # to return series with rolling medians replaced*** I'm using this format.[OUT]:.So with my data frame I want it to replace the outliers in each column with the column median, I am using a window = 21 and a threshold = 6 (b/c of the data setup). I should mention each of the column starts with a different number of 0's for the rows. So for example the value for the first 80 rows for column one may be 0's and then for column 2 the first 95 rows may have 0's because each FIPs code has a diffferent number of days Given this I tried to use the .apply method with the following fx:.However, when I printed my data frame is now just all 0's. Can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?.Thank you!",

However some countries have no entries (not Na or NaN, just non-existent records) for certain dates..I want each country to have a value for total vaccinations for the whole date range of my dataset, naturally filling it with 0 for any dates that currently have no data..What is the easiest way to achieve this? I'm guessing this is a pretty trivial question, but I'm just starting with python and pandas..In more detail:.I'm using the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress. I add it to a pandas dataframe:.I'm grouping the dataset by country and date and summing the total vaccinations:.However, I get left with some countries that simply don't show up for certain dates - they aren't NaN or NA, they just aren't present..For example:.Returns:.I think this is because the UK started vaccinating earlier than all the others, so there simply aren't any records for China and the US at the start of the vaccination process. So for later dates, they show up as \"NaN\", which is easy to fill with 0s using fillna(), but for earlier dates I'm not sure what to do..Here's an example for the United States from the original covid_df dataframe to further illustrate my point:.As you can see, the United States doesn't have an entry for dates earlier than the '2020-12-20', so there's nothing for fillna() to fill..I came up with the following solution which works, but I'm pretty sure it's very inelegant, and I bet there's an incredibly simply solve staring me in the face:.The reason I need to achieve this is because I want to draw a stacked bar chart plotting the total vaccinations over time, but I get errors if each country value doesn't have an entry for each date, when trying to compute the \"bottom\" argument of the matplotlib.pyplot.bar() method:..Thanks for reading!

I am making a pdf from the saved images so I do not need or want them to show. It runs perfect with plt.show(). I just have to manually close these plots for the program to continue....I have the john hopkins covid data being read into pandas to create many different charts and this is the only plot I have issues with though most are quite similar. For my final plot it is reduced to single column sum of the total cases/deaths for use with bar charts. I stumbled onto merging two plot types, bar and area, which makes a cool effect. However, I am sure this is not the issue as I comment out one and still get the plots to display on top of each if i do not add plt.show()",

The problem is that the 1st day of a week does not necessarily match the 1st day of the month. Therefore, there is an overlap I don't know how to handle (two successive months placed in the same week)..I am visualizing surgical procedures before and after Covid-19..The x-axis correspond to consecutive weeks since monday 2017-01-02 (yyyy-mm-dd), and ranges 1 - 209. Each geom_point() correspond to number of surgical procedures per week...Normally, I would simply break the x-axis into smaller ranges, e.g. x-axis breaks corresponding to 3 months. Unfortunately, as b$cons_week count each consecutive monday passed since 2017-01-02, it does not necessarily correspond to \"month breaks\" (as the 1st day of a month is not necessarily coinciding with 1st day of the week). Therefore, I have no idea how to break the x-axis..My data look like this.First, I calculate number of surgeries per week:.So that.Then.I was wondering, can b$diagnosis somehow be utilized for breaking the x-axis?

I currently have this visualization:..I am trying to determine if I have the correct methodology for calculating the 95% MOE. I have used the following formula to create a MOE 95% calculated field:.Where Value is the pivoted field I generated which holds all percentages, and N is the number of participants. This is a standard MOE calculation, but when comparing it against other data providers (e.g., Urban Institute), my MOEs are showing up different and I cannot access their methodology..Any assistance would be appreciated — I'm a bit in over my head!",

My dependent variable (e.g. mask wearing) is a factor (0 representing no mask, and 1 representing mask worn).

You can see the newly added property is added by drilling down in console.Just comment in/out the three lines above to see the template renders fine before the new property is added, but when the code with the spread operator is called nothing renders but I can see the new calculated property is present for each of the 88 object/rows returned..I thought it might be a timing issue, rendering before the data is available so I tried a reactive approach i.e. only observables and using the async pipe in the template and I tried making the data service return a hard coded object with the same shape as the endpoint..Can someone advice me or show me a working similar example’ thanks in advance!",

  "question_body": "I found this data file on covid vaccinations, and I'd like to see the vaccination coverage in (parts of) the population. It'll probably become more clear with the actual example, so bear with me..If I read the csv using df = pd.read_csv('https://epistat.sciensano.be/Data/COVID19BE_VACC.csv', parse_dates=['DATE']) I get this result:.I'm particularly interested in the numbers by region & date.\nSo I regrouped using df.groupby(['REGION','DATE']).sum().In order to compare vaccination 'speeds' in different regions I have to transform the data from absolute to relative numbers, using the population from each region..I have found some posts explaining how to calculate percentages in a multi-index dataframe like this, but the problem is that I want to divide each COUNT by a population number that is not in the original dataframe..The population numbers are here below.I think the solution must be in looping through the original df and checking both REGIONs or index levels, but I have absolutely no idea how. It's a technique I'd like to master, because it might come in handy when I want some other subsets with different populations (AGEGROUP or SEX maybe)..Thank you so much for reading this far!.Disclaimer: I've only just started out using Python, and this is my very first question on Stack Overflow, so please be gentle with me... The reason why I'm posting this is because I can't find an answer anywhere else. This is probably because I haven't got the terminology down and I don't exactly know what to look for ^_^",

Each column is some attribute about their journey: where they got on/off, the time they they got on/off, how close they were to an infectious person, whether they themselves were infectious and then the dose they received through breathing it or touching a surface. Then there are columns about the passenger loading, prevalence of then virus in the community and others about the train itself. So these are a lot of repetition and no indexing.

It's going to fetch covid-19 data from the Madrid (where I live) government website, organise it by locality, and serve it up through an API..Here is a sample of the JSON data I'm consuming..Each JSON object is a a record of cases and the infection rate on a specific date and for a specific municipal district..After fetching the data the program: parses it, filters it, trims/rounds some properties, maps it by locality, uses it to create an object for each locality (DistrictData), and writes the locality DistrictData objects to a MonoDB instance..At the moment I have split each of these steps in the process separate classes, as per the single responsibility principle. As can be seen in the linked screenshot:.screenshot of intellij package structure.My problem is I don't know how to link these multiple classes together..At the moment I have a Manager class which smells a bit like a God Class to me:.I also thought about linking all of the involved classes together in a chain of Injected Dependencies -> so each class has the next class in the process as a dependency and, provided nothing goes wrong with the data, calls that next class in the chain when it's time..I do also however feel that there must be a design pattern that solves the problem I have!.Thanks!",

I created an API key as well as an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (although I am admittedly somewhat lost what this does and how to use it)...I next tried to login with my api key by running.but that also didn't get me beyond 33ish.

I made the mistake of creating a python environment for a rust app(forgive me, I am just a beginner). Then I fixed it by undoing the changes to the best of my knowledge. Then I learned that Rust requires a buildpack and then I implemented it(hopefully). Then finally I learned of the importance of Procfile and made this (I really hope I didn't get the Procfile wrong)..I dint create a \"web\" process type cuz I think it's only needed when you have a web interface or require Heroku to accept from one..A Heroku app’s web process type is special: it’s the only process type that can receive external HTTP traffic from Heroku’s routers. If your app includes a web server, you should declare it as your app’s web process..Now the problem is that Heroku is showing me this error code while I try to open the app..Application error An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served. If you are the application owner, check your logs for details. You can do this from the Heroku CLI with the command.I figured this was because I was not using any web interface..Then I checked the log files and this happened.I tried specifying dyno and also rechecked my \"P\"rocfile's extension\"no extension\" I am getting the fundamentals wrong somewhere and not sure what I am doing wrong.\nThank you for helping me out",

The ones I've looked at are\nhttps://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw and https://github.com/nRo/DataFrame.\nHowever, I have only ever used \"Java with Ant\", and both of these GitHub's only mention using the library through Maven dependencies in the pom.xml file. I have never used Maven, and I am very unfamiliar with Build Tools in general. As when I was introduced to Java, my teacher instructed me to use Java with Ant. That being the case, any time I have used an external library before I have simply added the .jar files into my library folder and used import foo.bar; or import foo.*; to use the libraries..Is there a way for me to use either of these libraries without switching build tools? For example, download the source and make the .jar's in a way that isn't overly tedious, so that I can use the libraries the same way I am used to? Or, perhaps something I'm missing that allows me to download them in that format? If not, seeing as almost every Github library I find instructs me to use it through Maven dependency, should I stop using Java with Ant altogether and start learning how to write programs using Maven?.Any insight is greatly appreciated.

I did not intend to break copyright issues. Actually, I thought a user who will hit that \"button\" will also give permission to access their files. I completely understand your concerns and I completely agree however - as an end-user - this is the problem requiring a solution in my case.

I do not know if it is OK to send links (and sorry if it is not) here but for example, this web site makes something similar to my idea but it is not free and it is so complicated for my -low socioeconomic - patient profile. My target population mostly deals with brain tumors and their level of concern for copyright issues is so low for that reason.

I couldn't find any similar question (actually only one, but with no clear answers, sadly), therefore I decided to put this here..I've been working on my master's thesis in Overleaf, I'm a longtime user and I try to be pretty careful about my code, and I never leave a report with syntax errors, or \"badnesses\" as Latex likes to call them. I was working on this two days ago, on a Windows machine, there were no errors, no badness of any kind, everything worked and I double-checked everything..Today, on my Linux/Ubuntu 18.04 machine, I tried modifying some small things (nothing to do with any packages or syntax, it was just plain text modifications) and then suddenly my references stopped working entirely. As I guess anyone who's sick and tired of Latex' No-Reason Errors would do, I deleted everything bibliography related and re-typed it all. So, the references are working again, the document compiles fine, but it still gives me this confusing bipolar message:.No Errors, good job! + Fatal Syntax Errors.(I still don't have the right to include images in questions, so that's why there's an external link to the image.).But also, I don't have much experience with bibliographies and citing, so I guess that is where the problems originated from. But even with deleting and re-typing it all from scratch, recreating the .bib file and all... This still comes up. I'm pretty much OCD and I would really want to fix it, and not see it coming up..You can see all of my TEX code, the .bib file and the Raw Logs here, on my GitHub profile..Has anybody had this problem before ? Sorry for the rant, any suggestion, idea or a thought is more then welcomed..PS: Hope this Covid crisis ends soon, I hope you're all fine during these crazy times.",

  "question_body": "We are trying to assess the possible effect of a wide range of factors (say 6 different regressors, say X) on cumulative active covid cases (target Y variable) for a specific country. Our ultimate goal is to investigate if these factors can be used to provide better/more accurate forecasts of our Y target variable..Through literature survey, we selected ARIMA model for modelling/forecasting. Our initial target variable consisted of daily values for the period starting from March. 10, 2020 up to January 31rst, 2021. Because of the length of our study period, we decided to model cumulative weekly total cases, instead of raw daily values. Our general approach is to use the first 30-35 values (weekly values) for model fitting, then the last 10-15 values for validation..We noticed that fitting a simple ARIMA model (using auto.arima under R, with the forecast package) produce fairly excellent calibration, but a poor validation. We also noticed that :.both performed poorly on validation..Arima fitting (weeks 1-32) and validation (week 33 and above) - Red: Simple ARIMA (0,0,1) fit - Blue : ARIMA (1,1,0) fit using external regressors. Black line shows observed values.Later, we noticed a substantial improvement could be attained on validation using the lagged values of our target variable :.Arima fitting (weeks 1-32) and validation (week 33 and above) - Red: Simple ARIMA (0,0,0) fit using lagged values of the modelled variable as a single regressor - Blue : ARIMA (1,0,0) fit using lagged values of the modelled variable combined with external factors as regressors. Black line shows observed values.What are your thoughts on these results ?.Is it a fairly common approach to use lagged values of the modelled variable as a regressor with ARIMA modelling ? Why adding this provides better results here?.Is it fair to compare the arima.model (using lagged values of our modelled variable) to another arima.model (using both the lagged values of the modelled variable and lagged values of our regressors as well) ?.Thanks for your time..Roland.",

  "question_body": "There must be an easy answer to the Winform charting question but I cannot yet work it out so I am asking for help advice. My chart is FastLine but I also tried just plain line..I made a app to plot Covid-19 vaccinations around the world. For UK I have data weekly for each country in the Union. England, Scotland, Wales and N Ireland. All that is good and I can display the data in a datagridview. Now I want to plot it like in a graph which is easy except ...... one small issue..Data started on 13 December 2020 but England only started on 20 December. This means when I start to plot the data I should have England starting from the second point but all I can get it to do is start from the origin. How can I get it not to draw from the origin?.The code I use is as follows.This produces the graph shown next. As mentioned I want the Black line for England starting at 20/12 and not 13/12 please...Picture of England Data and then one of Scotland's data so you see the missing England week....EDIT -05 Jan.I have since tried to fool it into having a default start then paint the fist step transparent. I now get the correct values inline but when I move from the first point and start to paint in colour it seems to repaint the whole graph each time and overwrites the transparent start. I change the code for England as follows.This gives me the following..what I really want is the following but how can I not make it paint the first bit..21 Jan 2021 - Just an update I gave up in the end trying to make it work and used 4 separate graphs. The problem I had was the data I was getting also kept changing its format so when I managed to get something working it did so for a few days then broke again. If anyone every finds how to do this please add a solution as I am very interested in finding out..",

  "question_body": "In yesterday's CodeChef contest I came across this problem in which I was able to write the code which was able to solve all the \"normal\" testcases, however, it failed when it came to a probable corner case that I seem to have missed..The question is as follows:-.Dr. Chef is treating COVID-19 patients. There is a queue of N patients (numbered from patient 1 at the front of the queue to patient N at the back) outside his clinic. You, his assistant, found out that for each valid i, the i-th patient has an illness level Ai..Chef treats patients based on their health, i.e. a patient with a higher illness level is always treated before any patients with a lower illness level. Chef is also fair, so he treats patients with an equal illness level based on their position in the queue, i.e. a patient ahead in the queue is always treated before a patient with the same illness level that is further behind in the queue..The first patient to be treated has to wait an hour for Chef to set up his equipment. Treating each patient also takes an hour, and Chef always starts treating the next patient as soon as he is done with the current one..The patients are a bit impatient. As Chef's assistant, for each patient, find out how long (in hours) this patient needs to wait before Chef starts treating this patient..Input.The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows..The first line of each test case contains a single integer N..The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN..Output.For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should be the time the i-th patient needs to wait..Constraints.1≤T≤5.1≤N≤105.1≤Ai≤1,000 for each valid i.Example Input.4.5.2 3 5 3 4.3.2 2 2.6.2 10 3 3 2 10.4.8 9 8 9.Example Output.5 3 1 4 2.1 2 3.5 1 3 4 6 2.3 1 4 2.Explanation.Example case 1: Patient number 3 has the highest illness level. Therefore, this patient just waits an hour for Chef to set up his equipment and gets treated immediately after. Patient number 5 has the next highest illness level, so they go next. They need to wait an hour for patient 3 to be treated. In total, patient 5 has to wait 2 hours. After that, both patients 2 and 4 have an equal illness level, but patient 2 is ahead in the queue, so patient 2 goes next, followed by patient 4, and then finally patient 1..Example case 2: All three patients have the same illness level, so they are treated according to their position in the queue. Patient 1 goes first, followed by patient 2, and then patient 3..Example case 3: Patients at positions 2 and 6 in the queue have the highest illness level 10. The patient at position 2 is ahead in the queue, so this patient is treated first, and then the patient at position 6 is treated. After this, the patients at positions 3 and 4 in the queue have the next highest illness level, so the patient at position 3 is treated next, followed by the patient at position 4. Similarly, afterwards, the patient at position 1 is treated, and then the patient at position 5 is treated..Example case 4: Patients at positions 2 and 4 in the queue have the highest illness level 9, so the patient at position 2 is treated first, followed by the patient at position 4, then the patient at position 1 and finally the patient at position 3..Approach.I approached the problem by storing elements Ai and index i in a vector of pairs and then sorting the vector according to Ai's to be able to access the highest levels of illness together in a sorted manner. I then started assigning hours from the first element of given Ai's in the range [1, 1000] in a descending order (higher order of illness is treated first). I came up with the following code:-.The above code passes the given the sample input but it failed the whole of the question i.e. there was a corner case which I could not identify. I've been thinking for more than a couple of hours now and am unable to think of any such case. Could someone kindly help me with the problem?",

On some Samsung devices this will trigger a SecurityException, and as far as I know Samsung throws this exceptions when your apps schedules more than 500 alarms.

But I haven't been able to reproduce this, and I don't see multiple copies of the alarm scheduled either..Happens only on SDK 28 and some rare cases on SDK 29.Question.Does anyone else here have the same experience working with the WorkManager Library and knows a way how to reproduce this issue?.Is there a work-around for this issue?.Crashlog.java.lang.SecurityException:  at android.os.Parcel.createException (Parcel.java:1966) at android.os.Parcel.readException (Parcel.java:1934) at android.os.Parcel.readException (Parcel.java:1884) at android.app.IAlarmManager$Stub$Proxy.set (IAlarmManager.java:240) at android.app.AlarmManager.setImpl (AlarmManager.java:722) at android.app.AlarmManager.setExact (AlarmManager.java:571) at androidx.work.impl.utils.ForceStopRunnable.setAlarm (ForceStopRunnable.java:292) at androidx.work.impl.utils.ForceStopRunnable.isForceStopped (ForceStopRunnable.java:151) at androidx.work.impl.utils.ForceStopRunnable.forceStopRunnable (ForceStopRunnable.java:169) at androidx.work.impl.utils.ForceStopRunnable.run (ForceStopRunnable.java:101) at androidx.work.impl.utils.SerialExecutor$Task.run (SerialExecutor.java:91) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker (ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1167) at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run (ThreadPoolExecutor.java:641) at java.lang.Thread.run (Thread.java:764) Caused by: android.os.RemoteException:  at com.android.server.SamsungAlarmManagerService.checkMaliciousAppLocked (SamsungAlarmManagerService.java:333) at com.android.server.AlarmManagerService.setImpl (AlarmManagerService.java:1758) at com.android.server.AlarmManagerService$2.set (AlarmManagerService.java:2100) at android.app.IAlarmManager$Stub.onTransact (IAlarmManager.java:92) at android.os.Binder.execTransact (Binder.java:739).Source: https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-notification-app-android",

Then the page is scrolled down to the CSV button, but I receive the aforementioned error, like if the button is still hidden by the cookie banner..The exact error (I repeat it down here), indeed refers to the cookie banner this way:.selenium.common.exceptions.ElementClickInterceptedException: Message: Element <button class=\"dt-button buttons-csv buttons-html5\" type=\"button\"> is not clickable at point (464,600) because another element <p class=\"cckInform\"> obscures it.I also tried increasing the wait time up to 5000000 but it did not make any difference..WORKING CODE.Thanks to @Prophet I was able to make it work.

I saw this StackOverflow post, but it doesn't deal with Python. The answer recommends to insert all statements in one go rather than one by one, but I don't know how to do that within Python. For anyone who has conceptual suggestions, please assist with coding that..Am I supposed to make my insert statement different? Move stuff around in the code? Create a loop? Please help and thanks.",

  "question_body": "I have 3 piece of data that I need to layer onto one plot. The first time series layer is coded:.The next layer adds two geom_hlines at yintercept=15000 and 17000 respectively. This layer is coded:.The final layer plots the points based on a categorical variable FL_Actions at the yintercept produced in the second code. This code is:.Now I need to layer each of these saved vectors on top of each other in one graph. When I use the code:.I get an error: data must be a data frame, or other object coercible by fortify(), not an S3 object with class gg/ggplot.

I'm a bit of a novice with ggplot but what I want to do seem fairly intuitive so I'm stumped..I've added images of each layer just in case...NOTE that FL_Actions shows up as NA in this sippet of the data. This is because policy actions did not occur until March and continued through November of 2020.This is the current ggplot created with suggested code:..Updating with suggestion. This is the code: ggplot(MI_FL_Data, aes(realdate, FLday)) + geom_line()+ geom_label(data=MI_FL_Data, aes(label=FL_Actions), nudge_x = 0.50, nudge_y=.25, size=2, na.rm=TRUE, y=15000)+geom_point(aes(realdate, 17000),na.rm = TRUE) + geom_point(aes(realdate, 15000), na.rm = TRUE) +  geom_hline(data = MI_FL_Data %>% filter(FL_Actions == 1),aes(yintercept = 15000), linetype=5, na.rm=TRUE) +geom_hline(data = MI_FL_Data %>% filter(FL_Actions == 2),aes(yintercept = 17000), linetype=1, na.rm=TRUE)+labs(x=NULL, y=\"Number of Reported Daily COVID Cases\", title=\"State of Florida\",caption=\"1= closing actions, 2= opening actions\")+theme_classic() and this is the resulting graph:",

This is referring to the line where I try to create \"date_df\" within the update_cards function. Doing some research on StackOverflow, I found a few examples that suggested date_select is a series of 1 value and that I need to stick a .values[0] on the end of it to select the one value - but this didn't work either.

I know I have to be pretty close, but I'm not quite sure how to access it..And I'm not sure you need it but if you do here is the COVIDvm:.I am pretty sure that in MVC if you don't specify the type for the view data object you are trying to use (which I am not doing right now) then it tries to use the string type which would obviously give me errors. So I need to define the type of object that VMlist is, but I have tried several different ideas to no avail. I think it needs to be something like var VMlist = ViewData[\"VMlist\"] as List<COVIDvm>;  or something similar but that doesn't work..You may also notice that this will throw some errors on the veiw: WebGrid grid = new WebGrid(VMlist, canSort: true, canPage: true, rowsPerPage: 5);  and then using it later: <div> @grid.GetHtml()</div> because I am not sure that VMlist is an acceptable datasource even once I have the object in the view correctly. I could be wrong about this though, but that isn't the primary concern of the question. The primary concern is passing objects from the controller to the view..What if I wanted to pass the LINQ query result covidQuery from the controller to the view for example? Is that possible?",

I believe this is the problematic step, since, when I apply this function to my corpus of tweets the similarity drops precisely in the moments where tweets are very related..Also I must say that my goal is to obtain a time series with a column for a measure of similarity and another for dates so it can be plotted.

After comment out the printf, the function still works. I was so confused..Just recall that before this test, I tested some memory dispose function, and perhaps had left some unfreed blocks in memory. Will that be the reason for fleeting segmentation fault? Thx bros..UPDATE: Now I can't even reproduce this bug myself. tokenizer.c above can pass the unit-test. I thought it might caused by makefile prerequisite rules. gcc didn't re-compile some object files when source code is changed..Thanks @Steve Summit, you make it clear that unfreed memory will not cause segmentation fault.

  "question_body": "first post. Trying so solve an issue I am seeing here between my Razor view and model. I have a popup window that is being fed a partial view and model..This works great on the first page render. I see the data fill my UI elements that are called from the @model on the razor page. When my user updates a field here and submits, I use this function.However, after the popup window is closed, and another popup is opened, we call that same ClickedCovid19Question IActionResult to populate our form again. It populates the UI fine with the new model it generated, debugging shows it creates a new model with all the correct data. The issue arrises when a user submits this form again, the model on the Razor view seems to think it is still the model of the very first submission. An example of this is the first line of the javascript function. When the razor view was created, it had the correct @Model.Par data, as I could see when I created a few elements to display it. However, when trying to capture that data using @Model.Par, it captures the original Model.Par data. Long story short, subsequent popups don't overwrite the Model data from the very first one. I am stumped, because this system works in so many other areas of our codebase. I can fix this buy creating hidden elements that will store the data I need to send in any requests, but I feel like there has to be a better answer than that..Edit: Below is an example I was using to test. The view part below will always display the correct par data in the id=parID input box. However, on the second popup and everytime after, if I was to run the simple javascript function below to find the data held by model, it will ALWAYS update to the data from the first model the page ever rendered, which seems inconsistent with other areas of my code that do work normally.",

  "question_body": "I am downloading a json file from the RKI in Germany (CDC equivalent). It seems to have dictionaries inside dictionaries inside dictionaries. I'm really only interested in the dictionary of data nested in the \"features\" dictionary. My problem is that each entry in this dictionary is nested with the same key - \"attributes\". This is what it looks like as text (I have to work with the text because I can't download it directly into python due to proxy issues - grrr.)..When I try to pd.read_json(the_file), I get the Value Error: arrays must all be same length..If I open as json and load, create a dictionary, I get my dictionary of dictionaries with the dictionary I want. I can almost get there, as below, but I end up with a list of nested dictionaries, where the key is always - \"attributes\" - which throws the error..I am wondering if I am coming at this the wrong way, of if there is a way to clean up my list (get rid of the attributes level).",

I cloned from the master branch of OpenNN a couple of weeks ago. Every time I try to add a layer, my program crashes without giving an error message. I am currently implementing a Neural Network for a Regression problem, so I took a look at the yacht_hydrodynamics_design example from OpenNN. But after copying this code to my code, I encounter this problem. So far I tried adding a Scaling layer and an Upscaling layer, but none of these work. This is my code so far:.As you can see, I have a class named NNetwork which is constructed like this (header-file):.When I deleted the last 6 lines of code in the function preparationForTraining, the program continues until the next crash happens in the function training, which gets called right after preparationForTraining:.I have the feeling that I missed something, maybe a critical line of code or something similar. It would be nice If anybody with experience with OpenNN could help me..Update: I moved the whole code from the function preparationForTraining into the main, and now the program does not crash. But this is not what I am looking for because I would rather do it in a function.",

  "question_body": "As I was bored and wanted to practice my python, I thought I'd write a script that took some genetic code and converted it into the amino acid sequence. It looks through the code one letter at a time and when it sees a certain sequence, starts translating triplets of genetic code into their equivalent amino acid and strings them together until it reaches a triplet of genetic code that doesn't encode an amino acid. The script then goes back to where it started this translation, and restarts iterating through the code until it finds another start sequence..The script works, up to a point. I started off using a while loop to iterate through the triplets of genetic code after a start sequence, but when it reaches the end of the genetic code, it goes out of range:.I can't figure out how to stop the script from running over the end of the genetic sequence. I tried using another for loop in place of the while loop, but I kept on getting an error: string indices must be integers, not str..Can anyone help put me out of my misery?.If you want/need some sample data you can use:.(Part of SARS-CoV-2 if you're interested)",

However, zt_ind_solve_power from statsmodels.stats.power gives back different results and I dont understand why! Here is what I did!

I know that otherwise, there is no need to do that, really... What made me wonder, is that the solve_power function gives back power=1.9% for p=0.0013 and power=6.6%, which appears to be way too low to be true, here.

  "question_body": "One method I have seen in the literature is the use of optim() to choose initial values for nonlinear models in the package nls or nlme, however, I am puzzled by the actual implementation..Take an example using COVID data from Alachua, FL:.dat=data.frame(x=seq(1,10,1), y=c(27.9,23.1,24.6,33.0,48.0,136.4,243.4,396.7,519.9,602.8)).x are time points and y is the number of people infected per 10,000 people.Now, if I wanted to fit a four-parameter logistic model in nls, I could use.But now imagine that parameter estimation is highly sensitive to the initial values so I want to optimize my approach. How would this be achieved?.The way I have thought to try is as follows.The result from optim() is wrong but I cannot see my error. Thank you for any assistance.",

  "question_body": "I'm looking into Covid Cases from a kaggle dataset. I've fitted a model to the raw data, however when looking at the Covid data from the UK we see a trough each weekend because testing drops, and a spike each monday/tuesday because there is a rush of positive tests from the weekend. This then if I am correct, should be considered as noise, as the peaks and troughs are not results of the the pathogen's behaviour, but instead due to human error. As such I initially thought I should fit my models to smoothed data..I have made use of a stacked bi-directional LSTM, from Tensorflow's Keras, but I am open to using other methods like GRU and ARIMA, and anything advised by you all as well..Below are a two plots, that are the results of the model:.Model fitted to raw case data:.Model fitted to 7 day rolling averages:.The model that is fitted to the raw data is slightly over-fitted which I can adjust with tweaks to the model complexity, and perhaps I'll shift to the RobustScaler() from sklearn. But I am also concerned that the model is effectively just \"learning\" the noise of the data instead of the general trend..On the other hand, the model that is fitted to the 7 day rolling average, is not over-fitted and sticks to the rolling average pretty nicely. However, unless I am mistaken and please correct me if I am; don't regression models assume independence between daily points? And when you start smoothing points, the results are directly dependent (in this case) on the previous 7 points..As such I conclude with my initial question: should I fit models to smoothed data, or stick to the raw data?.My thanks to anyone that answers!",

The input is given by the user on an HTML page called \"profile\" which then redirects to either \"myappointments\" or \"mydetails\" - depending on which they want to view. I'm unsure if this is important.I know it'll probably end up being easier than I'm thinking it is, but can someone provide me with some help or guidance on how I might do this?

But I guess there is no way for ggplot to work with s3 objects / data.table..And only time difference I am getting is when I use data.table & pass it as data.table otherwise there is no benefit.",

Let me explain a simplified version:.Simple Version: Let's say I have Survey A, which I run every day. Today's survey I save as Survey A1, tomorrow I save it as A2, etc. Each individual day's survey contains frequency weights for the sample of that day..Now, when I go to do my analysis of the survey, in order to increase my sample size, I aggregate all of the surveys together (A1, A2, etc. are all combined). How do I properly take into account the frequency weights now that I have combined the survey data, given that the weights were based on that individual survey day?.Actual Data: The actual data I have is related to COVID-19 (symptoms, hesitancy reasons, etc.), and it is global. It is also collected by Facebook so in order to make it representative of the countries actual populations, frequency weights are used. I thought taking into account frequency weights would be as simple as, for example, including the weights in a weight =  argument for a certain function (like count(x, wt = weight))..And it still may be that simple, the issue is that when I look at the implied population totals for each country, they are insane, like 2.7 billion for Bangladesh. I would expect, if I am weighting properly, to have something close to the actual population. So, I get the sense I am doing something wrong..I am really not sure how to proceed on this, any guidance would be much appreciated. Happy to provide more detail as well.",

  "question_body": "1. Summary of Problem I want to track and visualize COVID19 trends and time-series because I have to send my children to school in a state that forbids mask mandates and county without the courage to implement them anyway. Last week, I build a scraping routine for their website using Python, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup. It is not pretty, but it worked to grab the data and I built a Jupyter notebook to analyze the data. Here is the repository:.https://github.com/Rosenheim-Lab/PCS_COVID.git.As I worked on analysis and generated the first few figures, the county changed the format of their website for reporting the data. Now it is a website that seems to be driven by Microsoft Power BI and there is no link by which one can access the tabular data. There is still a visualization, and I wanted to know if there is anyway to scrape from this type of carpentry. Their COVID19 dashboard is here: https://www.pcsb.org/COVID19Cases ..2. What I've Tried In the repo you can see that I have a Jupyter notebook-based scraping page employing a Python module as well as a Jupyter notebook for data analysis and visualization. I am new to web-scraping and had quite a bit of help from some friends. This is not the cleanest, leanest, meanest code, but it worked. Now it doesn't work because I am having trouble interacting with this new format through the Power BI UI..Code? I have not yet tried to code this out. The only way I did it before was with Selenium and a webdriver. I am having trouble finding where the tabulated data are in this new set up. I have done simple analysis like this: and I wanted to keep that up. It would be great to get the data in the same format, however they are not presented in that format. Ultimately, I wanted to map the schools and compare the percentage infected to political maps of the county.",

  "question_body": "2 years back, I was tasked to quickly build a system for an Health Club that was hit by the Covid pandemic. The system was built within a week & I used what technology I was comfortable with and deployed the system..The requirements were simple - A member subscribes to a program and he gets regular, timely notifications via FCM. The signup date of the member is rolling, hence it has to follow the n+number of days & time schedule logic..I built this using simple php with nodejs handling the scheduler. The scheduler runs every minute, checks the mariadb database and runs a loop to send these notifications. This is running correctly at the moment. Having said this, I know this is not the optimal way of doing a solution like this..I would compare this to the \"Autoresponders\" we set in any mailing system. Once a person joins, we can schedule Autoresponders - the sending and delivery is managed by the mailing provider..I wanted to understand if I can use Topics or Realtime / Firebase database to achieve this?.I know it's a super generic question, but if someone can point me in the right direction, I would appreciate it..Regards, Mihir.

  "question_body": "I know that the dependent variable can be expressed in matrix form with cbind(). That is not what I'm asking. It is also clear to me that the results are identical. However, the ability to generate areas under the curve and similar plots is no longer straightforward with a binomial type of formatting of the dependent variable (versus a Bernoulli dependent variable of 0's and 1's)..In the following code I am looking at recent data from the US gov including number of vaccination doses per state per 100K people (d$jabsx100k) and the number of hospital beds (inpatient and ICU combined, for example) occupied by COVID patients in each state, d$TOTpos, versus those occupied by patients with any other diagnoses, d$TOTneg..So if a line of the dataset is:.I would like to turn into.just to run glm(COVID ~ jabsx100k, family='binomial')..Instead, as you can see below, what I ran is.glm(cbind(d$TOTpos,d$TOTneg) ~ scale(d$jabsx100k), family='binomial').which works just fine, but it doesn't allow me to use the pROC package to do other things with the model after it's run..Going in the opposite direction is easier with the aggregate() function, but I don't know how to \"de-aggregate\" the counts..If there is any way of calling glm() that circumvents the need to do cbind(success, failures) it would indirectly answer the question well..The code:.Please note apropos of the answer that I did already scrutinize the site for ideas, including the option for weights in the glm() function. In particular, fit3 <- glm(d$Proportion ~ scale(d$jabsx100k), weights =d$TOTb , family=\"binomial\"), where d$TOTb is the total number of beds..This is not an improvement in any way, since I'm still stuck in the same issue of not having a Bernoulli format of the independent variable to allow me to do AUC plots and other stuff like that after the regression..Also trying to pre-empt...

I've been looking for an answer for a while but doesn't work well for me..I'm trying to get covid-19 data from this website: https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn/viet-nam-full.html.Normally I use Inspect in the browser to fetch the API URL from the website, which worked..But for the past few days they seem to added some kind of token, which still allow me to see the data on the website but not possible to fetch the data with get request without the token..For example: The API link.In the past, I could use the following code to get data and modify parameter to change the data range if necessary..But now it requires me to input some kind of token which I fetched from the request headers in Inspect mode to get the same data, and it's not possible to change the date to get data anymore..For example: x-data-token.When I try to change the date in the url it just returns 'Token not valid'..What I need help with is how I can get this token automatically with Python (I don't want to open the browser and copy the token everytime) and get the data with different parameter values (the date)..If anyone can show me a better way to do it. I would be very graceful. This is my first post and I'm new to this so I tried my best to explain the situation. Thank you very much.",

  "question_body": "I am working on a project regarding demand forecasting for pharmaceuticals..So first of all:.The raw import data which used includes information of; import dates, labels of active pharmaceutical ingredient (Product Code), and quantities in an excel table. For example:.First of all i need to merge the same dated and same labelled entries, for example, there is only one importation on 18/06/2019 for product labelled as \"1\". Also i need to convert the data frame to time series, sorted by dates and with 'Product Code' as a character and 'Quantity' as numeric. When i try with the following code, the result is the following:.Both 'Product Code' and 'Quantity' are in character format. Also you might have noticed, it will be difficult to forecast for separate products on a single table. Do i have to separate all products to different tables and forecast them separately?.You can access to a sample data set from this link*..Thank you,.Best Regards..First Edit, i have worked on the solution which @g-grothendieck shared:.My data is tidied up as this, as data.frame:.and then i continue but get this error:.An addition to my First Edit (edit v1.1.); @g-grothendieck showed, i've made a mistake with a column name, and corrected it. And the code follows as this:.and i received the following error:.An addition to my First Edit's Edit (edit v1.2.); with the help of @g-grothendieck, the code has finally compiled with 'Product Code's separately, using the zoo package and the as.yearmon command:.and the output data is time series, with a tidier fashion. Also i can manipulate different product group with different frequencies using as.yearqtr (also addition from @g-grothendieck).For the 2nd Edit, i have converted date to month/year and followed the codes which @rob-hyndman presented:.and i received this error:.that i can't continue on forecasting....For my 2nd Edit's Edit (edit v2.1.); @rob-hyndman explained that the error happens because i've edited the date before using the code, so the function will no longer be able to interpret the dates. I've fixed it my code as following:.It has compiled without errors, you might have noticed. I've re-edited this line; import_date = quarter(dmy(import_date), with_year = T), because import aren't frequent, most of the pharmaceuticals imported three or four times in year, so i've changed the dates to/as quarterly. and then i proceed to forecast as @rob-hyndman suggested:.And i've received that error... Any methods that i can forecast with quarterly data..3rd and the FINAL EDIT:.With the help of brute force, i've successfully forecasted all of the data at once:.Since croston method for forecasting is valid for intermittent demand. I've to organize the data according to infrequently imported pharmaceuticals and frequently imported pharmaceuticals. And for the frequent ones, i should find a suitable method for forecasting..This will be the last entry for this post. I'll probably post the data set and the related codes and algorithm in github. Many thanks to @sevgib, @g-grothendieck and @rob-hyndman for their help..P.S. It would be great if there could be a way to use deep learning algorithms for demand forecasting of pharmaceutical products. There was a study which included Facebook AI packages for pandemic forecasting, i think this one*",

I will be given a query for this scenario that I will have to correct. So I need two things: laboratory test results and readmission rates..The first thing that comes to my mind is that ResultValueNBR should be equal to 1 because that will isolate the COVID positive patients. I am unsure about the rest and teh structure of the query. I think for readmission rates I need (COUNT) of PatientEncounterID or the count of AdmitDTS and DischargeDTS, WHERE COUNT(PatientEncounterID) > 1 or something like that to count the the RE-admissions which means any extra admissions after the first admission..And for the test results I think I need the ResultDTS or the count of positive and negative results, so if we have the result dates joined with readmission dates in one table (only for positive patients) then we can use this data to plot one by the other in a scatter plot and see if there is any correlation..I am just trying but I am not sure what to do exactly, please help..I think that the headers of the solution table should be something like: PatientID | Count of positive | Count of negative | Count of readmissions |",

And if they have been on vacation they need to wait an extra month as well..So,.male = +2, female = +1.vacation; yes = +1, vacation; no = +0.covid; yes = +0, covid; no = +1.So a male who has been home all the time an have had covid needs to wait.2 + 0 + 0 = 2 months..And a female who has been on vacation and have not had covid needs to wait.1 + 1 + 1 = 3 months..The function I'm trying to do is like this.And to test it one could do.I also stumbled across the today()-function, which maybe could be a better way to keep track and give a specific date when a person is allowed to visit.
