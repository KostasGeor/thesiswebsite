I want a dataframe that looks like this from each state.With my attempt, containers is empty.I understand I'll need to loop through to get the info for each state but I need help getting the basic code to work. This is my first attempt at webscraping; I'm pretty sure I'm using the wrong tags or findAll arguments. I've tried a couple of different combination and none work..I found a lady who did something similar to what I want here: https://towardsdatascience.com/scrape-cdc-for-covid-19-cases-a162924073ad.But she's a developer I think and her skills are above mine. There has to be a much simpler way to do this. Right?.Thanks in advance.",

   "question_body": "Okay. I am currently looking for ways to tackle a specific challenge. I start off with a PDF file and my goal is to turn this into a JSON object. I used a third party library to turn the PDF file into XML, and now I am trying to parse the XML into JSON. However, I could also just parse the PDF straight into a POJO or JSON without going through the XML step if that would be easier, but I believe that parsing from XML is easier..I have a complex XML (or PDF) representing research papers, with multiple sections each identified by a title unknown beforehand. This title could be anything. I know what some of the titles are, such as \"Abstract\" and \"Introduction\". These would be easy for me to parse. as we have specific sections for these in our JSON schema. However, we also have a \"full_text\" section that contains the text from the rest of the document. Each paragraph in the \"full_text\" will also have a \"section\" identifier, which shows what section the paragraph belongs to (such as \"Conclusion\" or \"Results\" or \"Discussion\"). The very specific need that I have is that each section in the PDF or the XML can have multiple nested subsections. But I do not care for these nested subsection titles -- I only care for the text inside them, as any paragraphs inside the subsections will belong to the top-most section containing them..In summary, once I find a section, say, Results, I need to get all the text within it and within its subsections and then move on to the next section on the same level as Results. The name of the sections and subsections are unknown to me beforehand, but their names will go into a simple String field called \"section.\".Edit: Looking at the complexity of the xml files, I now believe parsing straight from PDF might even be better.",

I set it up to pull data every 30 minutes but recently tested it on updates every 30 seconds..The idea is that it creates the request to the site, pulls the html, creates a list of all of the data I need, then restructures into a dataframe (basically it's the country, the cases, deaths, etc.)..Then it will take each row and append to the rows of each of the 123 excel files that are for the various countries. This will work well for, I believe, somewhere in the range of 30-50 iterations before it either causes file corruptions or weird data entries..I have my code below. I know it's poorly written (my initial reasoning was I felt confident I could set it up quickly and I wanted to collect data quickly.. unfortunately I overestimated my abilities but now I want to learn what went wrong). Below my code I'll include sample output..PLEASE note that this 30 second interval code pull is only for quick testing. I don't usually look to send that many requests for months. I just wanted to see what the issue was. Originally it was set to pull every 30 minutes when I detected this issue..See below for the code:.When I check the code after some number of iterations (usually successful for like 30-50) it has either displayed only 2 rows and lost all other rows, or it'll keep appending while deleting a single entry in the row above while two rows above loses 2 entries, etc. (essentially forming a triangle of sorts)...Above that image would be a few hundred empty rows. Does anyone have an idea of what is going wrong here? I'd consider this a failed attempt but would still like to learn from this attempt. I appreciate any help in advance.",

As the website does not show all comments, but gives only the possibility to load 10 comments a time, i try to load all comments with selenium in python and then give the output to BeautifulSoup..The HTML segment of the website that corresponds with the button \"Weitere Kommentare (10)\" and which loads the next 10 comments is:.It loads the next ten comments (second div below, only one shown here instead of ten) and a new button for loading another 10 comments (a):.My approach was to write a script that automatically clicks \"Weitere Kommentare (10)\", waits until the next 10 comments and the next button \"Weitere Kommentare (10)\" is loaded, finds the button, clicks it again... until all comments are loaded. My attempt was following (I center the button to avoid a pop-up at the bottom of the page, which would obscure the button):.Unfortunately that code never goes through. At some point the button \"Weitere Kommentare (10)\" just does not appear anymore and a \"NoSuchElementException: Unable to locate element: .moreCommentsAjx.bluebutton\" is thrown (weirdly despite it being supposed to ignore it). What puzzles me is, it´s not systematic. Sometimes it manages to load a couple hundreds comments before it fails, sometimes only 30 etc. Occasionally a StaleElementReferenceException is thrown (again it should not, but it does), when the scrolling seems to fail and does not center the button, but that's seldom..Thanks in advance for any help.",

I believe there are about 3000+ counties in the US. You can see more info about this API here:.I am getting lost in a sea of documentation for what should be a pretty straightforward operation. Do I need to create an application and authenticate, then send that token along with the GET request? How should the headers be formatted if thats the case? I checked both authentication and Rest API feature level tutorials, there was no mention of how to authenticate a request in either of them. If anyone at Esri is reading this please fix that..In summary, I just need to make sure I get all the data from the API request. Right now it's only 1000 counties. I need all 3000+. Thanks.",

I have a question about improving the efficiency of regular expression search in a pandas DataFrame..I've organised the dataset so I have dataframe with a title, abstract and the full text of the article in each row. The goal is to search the full text for keywords using a regular expression, and then return a set in a new column. As a first step, I am searching for the virus mentioned in each article. I am also using a dataset from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses to help me identify the virus (https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/master-species-lists/m/msl/8266).While I understand that my dataset is large, and there is a lot of data in the \"Full text\" column (400,000+ lines, and 100s of words in the full text column) , my current script run has ran for 2 days non-stop. I would like to check whether if there is a way to improve it's efficiency, as I want to run other regular expression searches, and preferably not have to wait for so long..I've created a mock dataset, but with the script I am using. Is there anyway for me to improve it's efficiency?.Mock dataset.This is from the ICTV website, I downloaded the spreadsheet from the website, to replicate, please download the spreadsheet, and change the folder path.Organising the data.I've melted the dataset into a single column. Articles may mention the same virus in different conjucations (coronavirus, coronaviridae, coronavirale etc. I want to capture all versions).From my understanding, all virus names will have the stem \"vir\" in it's name, it can be at the beginning, the middle or in the end..These lines attempt to capture prefix fof the virus using a regular expressions.This converts the list returned from the regular expression to a string..This step takes all the virus in panda's series and puts it into a single string. Also, thank you for providing this code (Python: Elegant way to check if at least one regex in list matches a string).This is the code I am most worried about. It runs the regular expression, and returns what it finds to a string. The \"set\" is to remove duplicates.This line runs the code and picks up the text by row. However, as mentioned, this is taking a long time..The script returns what I want, but it is slow.I apologise for the very long entry, but I wanted to provide as much information to recreate the problem. The script works (I think), but as mentioned, the script has been running for two days..Any help would be appreciated.",

These have worked OK till recently when some sites result in certification errors. I do not understand the details, and I cannot find a simple tutorial for people who know relatively little about certificates (e.g., what one looks like and how it obtained or created). This is a request for a default explanation of the simplest case and how to fix it. Typical error:.I can access the URL through browsers (Firefox, Chrome) and get HTML which represents what I want, but cannot access this programmatically..I have read several accounts of how to fix this (e.g. [2]), but they generally refer to \"your Keystore\" or \"trust manager\" as if everyone knows what these are. I am concerned that if I don't know what I am doing, I could break security. I don't know how I add sites to these or whether I even should..I am on MACOSX and appear to have a binary file.Some of the answers suggest I should have a file called \"truststore.jks\" but don't say where this should be or how it was created..So I am asking for a simple explanation of the system components and the simplest way to fix it. In some cases, I can avoid it (e.g., by using curl from the command-line), so I don't know how much this is a Java (8) problem..EDIT: Trust Store vs Key Store - creating with keytool seems to explain the difference between KeyStore and TrustStore, but I still don't have insight into what to do..[1] http://machinepublishers.github.io/jBrowserDriver/com/machinepublishers/jbrowserdriver /JBrowserDriver.html [2] Using a custom truststore in java as well as the default one",

However, this only presents the first such occurrence. I know I can find the others by using array_keys (found in positions 52, 78, 80), but I'm not quite sure how to cycle through the matches, since array_keys also results in an array.

So I am trying to code a loop to generate 25 plots. Only as a matter of example I am only using 4 variables:.I generated a vector with the names of the regions:.And I created an empty list to store the 25 plots within:.Then I used this for loop to generate and store each plot in the list \"regiones\":.The loop created r1 and stored the plot within but when w = 2, that means nombre_regiones[w] = \"La Libertad\" I got the next warning:.Because of that I can't create the second plot and the same thing happens with the third region \"Madre de Dios\". I tried different things and look up for similar cases but I didn't have luck. Also regiones[[w]] <- nombre isn't working but that's something I'll look up later. Thanks in advance.",

This is CSV data with 5 columns (date, county, state, FIPS (a 5 character geographic identifier which sometimes has leading 0's and also has some NULLs), cases and deaths). The problem is that cases and deaths are cumulative. The problem was to try to reorganized the data by date, state, and county, then determine the number of new cases and new deaths each day. The first thought was to do this by a Cursor, which took forever. A crafty contributor here had suggested self-joining the import table with an added RowID, and off-setting the RowID by 1 in a WHERE clause, hence:.The next job was doing a conditional subtraction of the previous day's cases / deaths from the current day's. There were three cases to deal with 1. The first row of the join where the previous day was NULL - this needed the first row values are those of the current day. 2. When the previous day's row was from a different state and/or county, the current day's values are those of the current day (like 1 above). 3. Where the state and county were the same as the previous day, a simple subtraction was performed.In SQL-Server syntax, the whole statement is:.This executed quickly (1 sec?) on SQL-Server with 80,000 rows.I rewrote this for MySQL as:.Unfortunately, this kept throwing an error immediately before.Eventually, I rewrote this without the FROM as.This actually worked and executed in 4.4 seconds.It appears the results are now the same for both SQL-Server and MySQL. My takeaway from this is that somethings don't directly \"translate\", and the Auto-complete feature in SQL-Server with more robust coloring of keywords and wavy red underscores and more complete error messages do make the coding easier that the editor in MySQL..I'd appreciate any thoughts about the SQL itself, and better editing tools (IDEs?) especially for MySQL..Thanks in advance...",

   "question_body": "I'm building an interactive time-series heatmap in R using Plotly and Shiny. As part of this process, I'm re-coding heatmap values from continuous to ordinal format - so I have a heatmap where six colours represent specific count categories, and those categories are created from aggregated count values. However, this causes a major performance issue with the speed of the creation of heatmap using ggplotly(). I've traced it to the tooltip() function from Plotly which renders interactive boxes. Labels data from my heatmap somehow overload this function in a way that it performs very slowly, even if I just add a single label component to the tooltip(). I'm using a processed subset of COVID-19 outbreak data from Johns Hopkins CSSE repository. Here is a simplified heatmap code, which also uses The Simpsons colour theme from ggsci:.Performance improves once tooltip = c(\"text\",\"label\",\"label2\") is reduced (for instance to tooltip = c(\"text\")). Now, I know that delay is not \"massive\", but I'm integrating this with a Shiny app. And once it's integrated with Shiny and scaled with more data, it is really, really, really slow. I don't even show all variables in tooltip and its still slow - you can see it in the current version of the app when you click on 'confirmed' cases..Any suggestions? I've considered alternative interactive heatmap packages like d3heatmap, heatmaply and shinyHeatmaply but all those solutions are more intended for correlation heatmaps and they lack customisation options of ggplot..",

At the sidebar there is a selectinput() with multiple=TRUE, and the problem is that every time the mobile user tries to select a value to update the plots, the screen keyboard is shown and the whole app is realoaded before the selection (for the correct usage the user needs to select the states and click on \"Atualizar\" button to update)..I tried to solve it by duplicating the siderbar section, and use {.no-mobile} for the first one, and {.mobile) for the second, and using multiple=FALSE in this second selectinput(). Unfortunately it won't work, and both sections were shown overlapping..I thought about another way (and i don't know how to do it), using something like multiple=ifelse(\"is mobile test\",FALSE,TRUE)..My questions are: Is there a way to test if the browser is mobile?

As the technical team leader, you have been summoned to brief management on the problem on hand. You are to:.Critically explain the challenge faced by your team in connection with the new and old computers and propose a solution to it..This is my answer to the question I am not sure if I am right:.Sign-magnitude is a way the computer stores negative numbers.

In order to build this model, I require the population of each location (country or province/state and/or county) to calculate the S (susceptible) in SIR. Since this dataset does not contain population data, I thought it would be good to do this using an API. I came across countryinfo, but the population estimates have not been updated since 2018 (according to the example and pypi); Also, one must be careful when entering country names as the ones accepted by countryinfo are not necessarily the same as those provided in the dataset..I can type generic queries (ie, type \"US\" or \"United States\") into google to find the population of any location, but I am not sure how to do this programmatically in python. Typing 'us' in-place of location below will show the US population (via this solution)..I think the wikipedia API can be used to the same effect, but I am not quite sure how to do this.

I've been given an inventory list for one of our smaller ship nodes - it consists of about 2k rows of two columns; SKU (unique item identifier; int) and Count (how many items are in stock). I also pull (via SQL) all of the orders of the last few days. This is upwards of 400k rows of 'ORDR_NBR' and 'SKU'; ORDR_NBR maps to 1-4 SKUs. The task, then, is to find out how many 'ship-complete' orders the node could have fulfilled if operational..My current approach uses Pandas; with dataframes 'df' (order data - sorted index is order number) and 'inv_df' (inventory data - sorted, unique index is SKU):.(Along with some later steps to subtract out inventory counts and rule out some orders via stock out).While the task is computationally heavy, the runtimes for the above line (3+ hours for 400k:2k matching on a corporate laptop) seem excessive.

The phones achieve this already by using layer 3 topology and all of that subnet is routed to the ASA automatically..However now that the soft phone traffic will be running over the same network as the data i need to send voice traffic one way and the remaining traffic the other way. i cant put the desktop on the voice subnet because then they the machine loses access to everything else such as domain/WWW etc..There are also too many voice subnets (well over a 1000) and we do not want to be putting each of the routes into the internal core network which is why we use Layer 3 routing..I have looked at PBR but i am not massively familiar with them so i would need to capture all voice traffic H323 and the 325 and other protocols as well as RTP traffic so i can set its next hop to the correct interface..Appreciate any guidance you can provide, if someone has an example PBR config they can send id be most greatful.Thanks D",

I would like to take the data each time that the CSV file is updated, and add the new data to a new row in a table so that I have a complete set of data. Alternatively, is there a way for me to grab all the data from the source (not just a one row latest update)? From the website, it appears they only make the latest row available. The data is updated approximately 2-3 times a day..I have searched extensively online and cannot seem to find an answer. I have set up the CSV file as a data source. I also copied and pasted the data into a new query, which can serve as my complete data source. So I have two tables (AllgemeinDaten and Old Data)..I create a new query appending the source (AllgemeinDaten) with Old Data, but it doesn't create a new row keeping the old data from AllgemeinDaten and the new changed data from AllgemeinDaten.",

   "question_body": "I am using the Folium package to build a \"Choropleth\" map with python. The data that is displayed is pulled from an API that keeps track of the most recent Covid-19 infected rates per country. A column shared between the countries.geojson file (a json file of a world map) and the data that I pulled is the name of the country. Most of the countries are shaded in with color (successfully), while some of the countries are not identical and therefore is shaded with grey, for example \"US\" in the pandas dataframe and \"United States of America\" in the .geojson file doesnt match, and therefore doesn't display their data on the map..The way I'm storing the API data is within a pandas DataFrame, because it works best with Folium. My hacky way of transforming the data from the country names that arent identical is with the code: covid_data.location[covid_data.location=='US'] = 'United States of America'.By doing this, the country name is now the same on both the .geojson file and the DataFrame.is now the same as.Before editing the dataframe, the map was rendered, but when US is changed to United States of America, it throws an error.return color_range[color_idx], fill_opacity IndexError: list index out of range.So that means that im setting the Choropleth threshold_scale to 636,360 (which is the highest # in the 'confirmed' column) but theres no data to match that # to. Therefore if I change the threshold_scale down to the next highest number, 177,644 (which is Italy) I get the error.ValueError: All values are expected to fall into one of the provided bins (or to be Nan). Please check > the bins parameter and/or your data..Heres the rest of the code to help resolve this issue,.You can see the image of the map (for some reason the threshold includes the USA #'s):..Let me know if theres anything else I can provide!",

I'm a relative newbie to R so.....I've done some fairly basic stuff with ggmap to plot spatial data, but never anything quite like this. Typically I just have points of interest that I need to overlay on a map, so I can use geom_point and their lat/lon. In this case I need to construct the underlying map and then fill regions and I'm struggling with doing that in the ggplot world..I've followed some online examples I've found to get as far as this:.Which produces this plot:..So far so good. But my new_counties dataframe now looks like this:.So I've lost anything that I might be able to tie back to my county level data on infections..My data has a 5-digit FIPS code for each county. First two digits are the state and last three are the county. My geoJSON file has a much more detailed FIPS code. I tried grabbing just the first 5 and creating my own data element I could map back to.But that produces this plot..And I have to say I'm not quite familiar enough with broom::tidy to know exactly why. I also notice as I type this that I need to filter out Puerto Rico!.If anybody can point me back in a useful direction....I'm not wedded to the current approach, though I would like to stick to ggplot2 or ggmap. My boss eventually wants me to overlay certain features. Ultimately the goal is to follow the example here and produce an animated map showing data over time, but I'm obviously a long way from that.",

   "question_body": "I have a Google Sheet workbook with multiple sheets being used to track COVID-19 cases in institutions across the country. The built-in Google Sheets geo chart works perfectly for the data visualization I need to accomplish, with one issue: It currently can't differentiate between actual 0 and \"no data\", which super skews how the..(essentially you can choose what color to use on the map for high value, mid value, low value, and no value. Where it should be using the color for \"no value\", it uses the low value color instead which makes the visualization confusing.).The reason it's doing that is the array it's using as its data source contains zeroes to represent \"no data available\"..The array is imported from a different sheet by using ={'State Totals'!N4:P54}. I found an explanation for how to generally use a formula to return empty cells, the example there being =if(B2-C2>0, B2-C2, \" \")..I'm extremely noob when it comes to these formulas, and I cannot figure out if I can nest an IF condition in an array import, or vice versa, or... what or how..Here's a link to the sheet in question, if that helps at all. Really I just need a formula that.I don't want to affect the origin sheet's zero handling, just the one that the chart's using. (I also am absolutely not being paid enough to try and rig up a better map with Google Data Queries instead of the in-built Google Sheets chart maker, so here's to hoping it's a simple matter of syntax.)",

   "question_body": "I am building a Rails app to pull data from the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 Github project and to calculate the daily growth rates for cases and deaths. I started this because I wanted to see the change in the data every day for my city of Nashville. Currently, I have a hard-coded html table, which you can see here, but I'm trying to make it dynamic so that it works for every county in the US..At this point I'm blocked trying to model the database and calculate the daily growth rates on a before_save callback because I'm not sure how to look up the records I need..What is a decent way to find a record in rails that is the adjacent previous record to the one you're looking up? I'm not even sure how to say that clearly in English, which is probably the root of my problem with not being able to get it into code. For instance, today vs. yesterday OR March 28th vs. March 27th OR March 31st vs March 30th, etc. I need to find the first record based on date and then find the last record from the day prior..It should be something similar to this before_save callback:.Here's the model where that callback happens..But, that approach won't work because there are times where the data might be incorrect for a previous date and it will need to get updated. For instance, the Tennessee health department might discover they had erroneous data for March 31st, so the Johns Hopkins data gets updated and thus the record in my database would need to be updated. So with my code above, the first time that happens it would call Update.last and save an incorrect growth rate for March 31st. Thus, I need the callback to work whether it's calculating the growth rate for today vs. yesterday or March 28th vs. March 27th, etc..It's an open project, so the entire app is here.

This is why i cut series, to compute my ratio i only need the n previous date/rows (past day) before the actual day i want to test..I found this computation on COVID 19 our world in data charts, but i want to compute this indicators for one country and for each day and not only the last day as picture show :)..For example, for the date 2020-03-04, i only need to compute ratio between 2020-03-04 and 2020-03-01 / 02 / 03 to find the FIRST date where ratio >=2.In this example 2020-03-04 there is no more death than 2020-03-03, so we don't want to compute a new delta ( the number of days before death multiply >=2 is the same than 2020-03-03 !). I explain this in Edit1/2 archived at the end of this post..We use a dictionary to store the first occurence of each cumulated value, so when i see that cum_value = value, i search in the dictionary to get the correct date (9 return 2020-03-03) for ratio computation..Here my actual working code to do that :.I'm not really happy with this code, i found that passing the entire DF to my apply method was weird..I'm sure there is some better code in Panda to do that in less lines, and more elegantly, using probably nested apply method, but i don't found how..The dictionnary method to store date of the first duplicate is also weird, i don't know if it's possible to do that using apply (reusing result of previous computation during apply) or if the only way was to write a recursive function..QUESTION UPDATED WITH EDIT 1/2/3, WORKING WITH DUPLICATE VALUES.EDIT ARCHIVED.Edit 1 :.I see that my code doesn't take in account when there is value equal at zero..2020-03-03 computeValue is equal to 3.0 and not 2.0, dela is equal to 2.0 days and not 1.0 days (like 2020-03-02).I cannot access previous values during apply computation, so i search another way to do that..Edit 2 :.Found a way passing a pre-computed dictionnary :.Now, when i found a cum_value equal to some value, i return the index used for computation.",

   "question_body": "I am running a series of websites with information about the COVID-19 pandemic in different languages. They live in their own GitHub repositories and are served using GitHub Pages. Right now each of these repositories has a copy of all the files except the ones that are part of the theme. Somewhat inconveniently, I have no previous experience with Jekyll, Ruby or GitHub Pages..I know there are multilingual jekyll tricks, but that is not what I am here for, mostly because I want sites on different domains..So I decided that it might be good to hijack the theme as a store for files common to my sites. So I made a test copy of my site without the common files. It uses as \"remote_theme\" a copy of the theme where I stuck my common files in the theme's assets directory, so they get pulled in by the different language sites. This works for images, PDF files and such: I just move them to /assets/images in the theme and it all works..However, next to data files local to each language, such as the menu below our site title, I also have some common data files, such as the list of languages that the site is available in and the list of volunteers we thank for their work. I'd like to also place these in the theme somehow so I don't have to commit them to all the repos separately... Cannot get this to work..What I have tried:.Adding _data to the regexp in the .gemspec file of the theme where it reads: f.match(%r{^((_includes|_layouts|_sass|assets)/|(LICENSE|README)((\\.(txt|md|markdown)|$)))}i).Does not lead to the data files being accessible.Creating dummy _data files that {% include the real ones from the theme's _include dir..\"found character that cannot start any token while scanning for the next token\".Set data_dir in _config.yml to assets/data.I can use the data files that are site specific just fine, but the data files on the theme side are not seen by the Liquid processing. (They are copied to the _site directory along with the site-specific ones.).Is there a way to have a GitHub Pages site with some data coming from its own files and some data coming from the theme files? I realise I'd probably have to rebuild the site to make the theme changes show. (Right?) (Is there a way to trigger a rebuild on GitHub Pages other than to change files? What does the version number on the theme do?).Is there a more in-depth writeup of how the files from the theme and the site get mixed and what order things happen in than the jekyll user documentation?.Please by all means also tell me if there's a much better, simpler and/or more elegant way to do what I am trying to accomplish. We have a fast-growing existing project, but I'm ready to do things differently if that's simply better...",

   "question_body": "I'll apologize in advance that the example below isn't \"minimal\" but I haven't been able to reproduce this behavior except in the particular instance of my full data set..I asked this question before here and thought I had found the answer, but the behavior has returned and is vexing me. Basically I have a script that reads daily COVID-19 case numbers and produces maps where the counties are color-coded by the percent of the population infected. The script produces five maps, a national one and one for each of the four official census regions: northeast, midwest, south and west. To cut down on size, the below is just the national and widwest maps..My original script actually produces animated gifs showing the spread of the disease, but they take a long time to render. The below version just gives a single plot of the most recent data and should run pretty quickly..I've used a dput in the below script to avoid you having to read a file and geocode locations (I commented out the code) but there is still a large csv file of county populations that has to be read in. I have posted it at pastebin here..This is the national map I got this morning when I ran the code..Note that there is a scale for the number of personnel at the bases (the colored diamonds) but there is no scale for the shading of the counties..Here is the midwest map. You can see from the code that it is the same ggplot just with a dataset that is filtered down to the counties in the midwest region...Now the scale is there. As mentioned in my previous question I thought that the answer had been something to do with the width of the image being insufficient to accommodate the scale. When I added a newline in the legend text to shorten it that appeared to do the trick. But now the legend is disappearing again, andmaking the output image wider has no effect. Plus, just by eyeball it would appear there is plenty of room in the national plot to accommodate the scale..Another bizarre aspect is the behavior associated with rounding the breaks. Below is a west map where I applied no rounding to the breaks..So the scale is back but it goes to 6 decimal places. If I try to round it to 2.I get this map..which surely indicates the horizontal space isn't the issue...if it can accommodate 6 decimal places then surely there's room for 2?.I've spent as much time trying to figure out this inconsistent scale behavior as I spent writing the original script. I need these things to be consistent so that I can provide them as work products on a regular interval.",

However, with the added data, if someone is able to do this in R, I will be happy with that as well..What I am trying to get is first the name. Then from the extended data section, I am looking ultimatly to get Address 1, Address 2, City, State Abbreviation, and Zip. I am fine if I end up with everything so long as it puts an empty field where there is no data. For example, Address 2 is often empty, just return an empty field and keep moving so that when I merge the lists, everything lines up..The example below only attempts to get Name and Address Line 1. I figure, if I can get this, then I should be able to extend it all the way..The additional code that I have tried is below:.When I run this, I get the first record with the first address line 1 perfectly, but I also get the following error:.AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'strip'.I believe that this is because in the first record, Address 2 is empty. Therefore, I believe that this is trying actually pull everything at once from the extended Data which is also not what I want..The real difficulty I am having is pulling the <Data name = \"...\"> ... </Data> fields..This is my first crack at XML/KML parsing, so any help I would greatly appreciate. I really have not a clue what to try next at this point..End file will be a CSV file with headers: Name, Address 1, Address 2, City, State, Zip. Honestly, I am also fine just getting rid of Address 2 as well. It's not critical to have..If you need further clarification, please just ask. Thank you in advance for your time.",

   "question_body": "I have just one Cassandra node, installed locally on my PC with Windows 10 (Core i5, 16GB ram, SSD drive)..I created a table like this:.The pesel is unique, 10-digits id of a person..Then I generated 10 000 rows of sample data, that looks like this:.Finally, I loaded the data using cqlsh: source 'cases.cql';.To load 10 000 rows it takes 51 seconds. Is that normal?.I was expecting inserts to Cassandra to be ultra fast, while this pretty much comparable with SQLite without transaction (59s). If I wrap inserts with BEGIN & COMMIT in SQLite, this takes less than a second. This brings us to another problem....Batch inserting. Slow batch inserting. To single partition, on single node..I wrapped inserts with BEGIN BATCH and APPLY BATCH;. After that, the source was taking so long, I stopped measuring after passing 4 minutes mark..Yes, I am aware of wrong usage of batch inserts. As far as I understood, it is an anti-pattern to use batch insert if it would require inserts to different partitions, which makes sense. This is not the case here..Why is batch inserting so slow on single node (thus single partition)?.What am I missing here?",

I got a great answer here as to how to get subset the data for a similar plot sampling three different countries, thanks to Ben Bolker:.Unfortunately, this is much more complicated in the US, and possibly China, because there are many entries for the United States, depending on the column Province/State, which in the US would correspond to county and state. Hence, there is overcounting (on the one hand the cases in each state are entered in different rows, and in addition, the same numbers reappear in other rows, broken down by county)..I just managed to get the data for the US without duplicates using the function state.name as below, but I don't have a similar dataset with the names of the pertinent political geographic partitions of China..Here is an example of the problem:..How can avoid duplicating counts each day due to these overlapping rows - the fact that they didn't split in two columns the state and counties?.Here is the working code for the US (China still pending):",

   "question_body": "I am creating an animated chart from a dataset (using ggplot2, gganimate, ggrepel...) but I can't seem to get the label to round during the transition frames. Thus it makes a big long decimal number on the label. I can semi fix it by setting the label text to 'as.factor' or 'as.character', which will then only display the actual value of each point in the dataset, but ideally, I'd love to show it growing as it does with decimal places, but as whole numbers (or a single decimal place). I tried using various 'round' functions but that doesn't seem to work. Any ideas? :).Code:.Image: Decimal Places in Offset Label",

I have something like:.Now I want to find the date when the number of cases became greater than 100 and use this date to adjust/normalise/whatever all my plots..So I what to somehow find the \"2020-03-10 105\" row and set two variables.to be able to do things like.etc etc to basically ignore everything before the date of >100 cases..I suppose, it can be possible using some basic for+if loop over the raws of my datafile but I am a bit stuck with his as I can't find a good example/explanation of how to iterate through datafile raws..P. S. Of course, I could do this with external tools but I'd prefer to not as I'm doing some batch plotting with quite some scripting around to gather the data, and would like to keep all the plotting logic inside my gnuplot jinja2 template to not over-complicate the whole stuff.",

   "question_body": "I'm a student and attending university lessons from home. My teacher just gave me this job, consisting to take all the titles and subtitles from an online italian journal that include the words \"coronavirus\" and / or \"covid 19\" in a certain time lapse (from 22th to 29th of January and just the 1st and the 8th of April), and transcribe them to an Excel file to analyze the words used..I searched online and assumed that this could be considered scraping, and that made my day considering that I should find something like 100-150 titles plus subtitles and I have a very short deadline. Unfortunately, I am also a beginner at this and all I could do by myself was finding a way to collect just the title from the webpage. I'm using, like a beginner is supposed to, Data Miner with Google Chrome..Practically I should find all titles and subtitles from the website \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" (whose link I attach below) that contains the words \"coronavirus\" and/or \"covid 19\" but there is a problem: I can see just the titles in the search page, but to get the subtitles I should click on the article and go to another page. Is there a way to obtain all the results with Data Miner or should I use another program?.So, just to make it simple: I can't figure out how to make Data Miner collect the title from the search page, click it to go on the article page, collect the subtitle and go back to the search page to pass to the next title and subtitle and repeat. I don't know if this is possible or it's just sci-fi, like I said: I'm a total newbie at this and it's the first time using these kind of tools..Url: https://www.gazzetta.it/nuovaricerca/home.shtml?q=coronavirus&dateFrom=2020-01-22&dateTo=2020-01-29",

   "question_body": "I'm embarking on an ambitious RStudio project, one that's similar to Jack Dougherty's On the Line collaborative book-in-progress about Hartford. I'm finding I need to keep several different kinds of notes: on the research itself, on my R coding, on how to use certain tools, on my configurations, etc..Initially, I just want to keep a diary focused on the background technology: how I configured the RStudio project itself, what packages I installed, why I started to use Packrat but then deleted the project and started over, that bookdown needs certain yaml fields in its index.Rmd file to work properly (took me a day to find this out), and so on. I figured I can't be the first person to have a need for record-keeping like this..So I started by looking for an R package, an RStudio addin, or a R Markdown template or literate programming that could insert dated entries, maybe handle tags, etc. Having no luck, I started to learn about the blogdown package..Soon I decided this is overkill. While I probably should start a blog about the book's subject (the crisis triggered by the coronavirus), this would not be the place to keep records of subjects like how to make bookdown work with a non-standard directory structure. Also, blogdown wants its own project directory, which sort of breaks the connection to the original project. (The blog and research project subdirectories do share a common parent, but this seems awfully kludgy.).So I came back to the idea of including this diary in the original bookdown project. But I know no other way to do this than with an Rmd file, which (I think) cannot automatically insert accurate date-time stamps in individual posts, use tags, etc. Since I'm so new to some of this stuff, I'm writing here to ask those of you with more experience, \"What's the best way to meet this common need?\" Can you recommend any tools that will serve this purpose well?",

What I need is to be able to add another set of data to be able to add a range as series in the chart but in a secondary axis..My \"code\" looks like this.2 problems here. 1 It works when I change one series to right vaxis, but as soon as I do a second, first reverts to left axis. 2 I don't know how to get a list of series in the chart with their index so that even if I make it to work I must guess which series have what data.Edit: I changed the code and it now holds the changes but I still want to get a list of series in the chart with id's and series header so I know what to change. here is an example https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_bTj8e3FZpbhdENwN9CdLYsqkJeqp313CGCJmPNtrr4/edit?usp=sharing",

   "question_body": "I'm trying to run an extension of V3 of the Imperial College London COVID model (their github repo is here: https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/covid19model). The only things I've changed are adding data for the four large Canadian provinces to the data from the 14 European countries for which the model is built, and extending the forecast to 30 days into the future (the default is 7, but the code is designed to allow this kind of extension)..The core function of the model is to estimate expected daily death tolls based on country fixed effects and the interventions that are in place to slow down the virus. It also produces expected death tolls under a counterfactual scenario where no interventions are ever used (e.g. the only thing that affects death tolls is the predicted total infections and the infection fatality rate), in the generated quantities block of the stan code..Every time I run it, though, I get warnings like these:.E_deaths0 refers to expected deaths given no mitigation interventions on day 128, the last day of the forecast, in region 18 (June 2 in Quebec, in this case)..the code for generating these estimates is.Where prediction0[i, m] is the estimated infections on day i in country m, N2 being the total number of days to estimate (128). ifr_noise[m] is a modifier for the infection fatality rate in country m, and f_rev[m] is a vector of probabilities of dying on each day after being infected. There's no reason any of the elements that go into calculating E_deaths0 would ever be NA, and while prediction0 is estimated at 0 in a lot of samples for late dates and the later values of f_rev[m] round to 0, that doesn't seem like it should cause a problem because no division is happening..This happens for different geographies each time. The dates also vary, although it's always the last n days of the simulation in a given region, with n between 1 and 8 or so. I assume the problem is in sub_col(prediction0, 1, m, i-1), because f_rev[m] is data, so there's no potential for sampling issues, and if ifr_noise[m] were taking NA values then all dates for geography m would fail. I don't see how, though, because prediction0 is generated immediately before E_deaths0 and never causes warnings..When I extract predictions of E_deaths0[128,18] or whichever estimates have problems in that run from the model fit, there are as many samples as I'd expect and they're all in a plausible range. I'm not sure whether I can trust those results, though, when the process to generate them throws random warnings..Anybody have experience with issues like this, or any ideas? Thanks.",

   "question_body": "This is the page I am trying to make it dynamic by enabling cross-filtering. So the thing is they are having multiple API..For the top first two: TOTAL CASES & DAILY CASES They are using this API and the third one in the top is based on this API..The bottom three AGE, GENDER, and NATIONALITY are from this API..In all the API one thing is common that is a date but there are some API in which some data are missing for few dates like there is a gap( Not available for some of the dates)..So I thought of combining all the JSON API in terms of dates and then allow cross filter because I believe I can enable cross-filtering between them. Correct me If I am wrong..Like If I click on gender female since it gives info about total cases where the patient was female so only confirmed cases from the Total cases will change not the recovered, deaths as data is not available. SO I guess I should combine the top 3 charts together and gender, age and nationality charts, together. Then Dc js would be able to handle nicely filtering between each segments (cases related to landmark, cases related to person info)..Line 123:.This is not working because I can't see console.log() output..https://blockbuilder.org/ninjakx/8c48ab6481311aa0452046d66c4d8701.So my questions are:.1) Why d3.queue is not working?.2) Suggestion whether combining all the datas together and allowing a filltering is a good idea or not as there is limited data. Should I go for cross filtering between the same api charts. So in this case I will have 2 segments (cases related to landmark, cases related to person info).. Using DC js I want to make it more interactive and display more info.",

   "question_body": "This may look like a duplicate question but believe me there is something new that I have observed with twitter..I had previously made a twitter scraper that fetches a given number of tweets using scrolling and waiting for dynamic elements. But it doesn't seem to work now. It doesn't scrape more than 10 tweets. Also the tweets that it scrapes is just the last 10 tweets (of all the tweets I load initially through scrolling).This function is supposed to scrape atleast n tweets. Roughly 10 tweets show up at the start. So I scroll the page n/10-1 times to load all the n tweets. Then I scrape all the div's with a particular class name..What I tried? I tried loading as many tweets I needed by scrolling to the bottom of the page, scrolled back up to the start of the page and then fetched the required elements. This is giving StaleElementError..I suspect this to be the reason for this: In the webpage when I scroll down so that a specified number of tweets load up and then return to the top of the page, the tweets that I had previously loaded disappear..I am looking for a simple and a standard way to solve this problem.

   "question_body": "I am building a dataset, ultimately to be used to make an interactive online data visualization app with Dash..This is my first project with Python (and programming in general), and I am trying to decide how best to go about retrieving, storing and updating the data for the dataset..This is the api I am using: https://covid19api.com/.documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest.I have written some code that pulls down the data I need on a per country basis and manipulates it to create series' that I need.As of right now I am just working with data for one country and using matplotlib as I figure out best how to present and process the data. Here is an example of what I have done so far:.The finished project should look something like this, but with rates of change on all countries: https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-opioid-epidemic/.First of all, the API is a community project and in development and I don't want to overload their system with requests, so I am trying to structure my project so as to minimize the amount of load that I put on their system. I'm - quite simply - not aware of what good/bad practices are with regards using apis, and I don't want to be \"that guy\"..As I said above, I also need to think about storing the data and updating it at appropriate intervals. It is time series data for 248 countries, and recording several variables, all of which will need to be manipulated in pandas and appended to regularly. Should I build one massive dataframe? Should I build a dataframe for each country, each variable?.Once I have created the dataset, I am hoping to update & append it using similar code to what I have above, using this api call: https://api.covid19api.com/summary.Is that a good plan and what should it look like?.My plan is to host on Heroku (or something similar), when it is finished..Thank you very much if you are still reading at this point. I know this is a very long-winded post, and I am asking a lot of questions in one go. I have been trying to think about how to proceed with this all afternoon, and I know that I need to make some fundamental decisions in order to proceed. Any help at all would be massively appreciated.",

He added the numbers of deaths everyday to date and added them. high figures..not max. because he doesn't want the highest death. he wants to know how many died yesterday.",

I am using 3 csv files from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases to produce graphs to track the covid 19 epidemic. These are purely for my use to learn Python and Data Visualisation. I have changed the dates in row one to be Day1, Day2 ect, dropped the Province/State, Lat, Long columns and set the Country/Region column as the index. Each dataset now has 107 columns and 267 rows. The three datasets are cases, deaths and recover. Things are going ok but I have a slight problem and need some advice. The graphs are updated with a new column each day and this causes me some problems when I try write code to show the daily increase in numbers from today over yesterday. Currently I have to manually update my code each day to compensate for the extra columns in the 3 csv files as my code reads like:-.So the last line has to be copied, pasted and then updated each day. There has to be a better way of achieving this but new to coding as I am, I cannot seem to get my head around it and figure it out. Any advice, pointers, help on how to look at and approach this problem would be greatly appreciated. I hope I have explained this clearly enough for you, if not my apologies and please post your questions needing clarification. Thanks in advance for any help.",

Each row/line of the csv is a case, starting from the first one to the last case uploaded to the data.\nThis csv has a lot of objects: if the test give positive or not of COVID or if the patient has obesity, smokes, etc. All of this is specified with SI or NO (yes or no) and are objects (I have another file with yes or no as 1 or 2).\nI want to plot in an histogram (or in any other kind of plot) the information referred to the comorbilites and if the case is positive or negative. I mean, how many cases that are positive have any comorbility (obesity, etc) or not.

   "question_body": "I have been working on a COVID-19 dashboard where I want to display the daily cases and daily deaths in the line graph. I can get the data from the following api https://api.covid19api.com/total/dayone/country/United%20Kingdom but it return me the total commutative cases and total commutative deaths on the given date. The data returned is in the following structure.Where Confirmed is the total number of cases detected on that day. To calculate the daily cases on the specific day we can subtract the confirmed from the previous confirmed of previous date. For example 2020-05-05 the number of cases confirmed on that day can be calculated by subtracting the number of cases on 20-05-04 the previous day. So the calculation would be 194990- 190584 = 4442. For the first object of the array the value stays the same since there is no previous record to subtract from as I will be fetching the day one when a case was detected in that country. Therefore the desired data would be the following.I am using Vue.js I think this could be a basic javascript function which can loop through the array and subtract the \"Confirmed\" of current object from the \"Confirmed\" of previous object. Please do let me know how this can be acheived. Many Thanks",

This doesn't happen with all files, just 80-100 (no rhyme or reason as to which ones). I can't figure how these changes seem to be \"leaking\" from one branch to another while I'm simply making changes to a single PDF..OR.B) Gitkraken shows dozens of new files that are numerated duplicates of existing files (\"file.html\" is duplicated, and a new file is showing in the repo branch called \"file 2.html\") Again here, this isn't all files, only a couple dozen (sometimes more)..In either case I end up abandoning the branch and creating a new one from the last time I saw Hotfix behaving as expected..It's been doing the latter (B) for a while now, but since it was only really a nuisance (I can delete a few duplicate files) I've been mostly ignoring it..However, the \"leaking\" changes has the potential to be crippling and to destroy my hotfix branch, and my ability to go back cleanly to the normal ops version when this stuff all ends. I keep dreading looking at the repo and seeing a hundred or more file changes in there I didn't make. This \"leaking\" has only started happening this morning, far as I can tell, but I've already had to abandon two new branches. If I end up doing this again, it will meet the definition of insanity..Now I just ducked back into Gitkraken after a system restart, (with Dreamweaver still closed so I can take it out of the equation) and now my COVID branch is showing the same behavior in reverse! 98 Changes from Hotfix are now showing in COVID branch..I'm beside myself.

   "question_body": "Background Information.I trained a classifier to predict three labels: COVID/Pneumonia/Healthy based on chest X-Ray images. It's a PyTorch implementation of COVID-Net. I use a training set to train on, validation set to save the best performing model, and then a test set to measure the \"real\" performance of the model. However, I noticed that my model \"learned\" to classify normal/pneumonia really good, but it just ignored the underpopulated COVID set. Therefore I choose to undersample (reduce the number of training instances of the other classes (normal and pneumonia) in order to get equal populations). This worked well, but my sample set has been reduced to ~1500 samples (low!). The results are somewhat worse than COVID-Net, I achieve an accuracy of ~80% and lower sensitivity on underpopulated classes (COVID) then they report. I suppose that they report better performance because they do not use a validation-set and use the test-set each epoch. I figured that they might indirectly overfit on the test-set because of that. I have chosen to explain this so that the reader gets a context..Question.I tried adding privacy to the training procedure by using Differential Privacy. Specifically, I used Facebook's PyTorch-DP module. Training works just as well if I choose to add almost no-privacy (this can be achieved by choosing a really low noise multiplier value (sigma), i.e. 1e-7) and a really high delta. So it's not that the module itself is not working/faulty, but, if I use a lower sigma (so I add more noise) then I get more privacy (epsilon decreases) but the model fails to fit the data at all. The question is: how do I manage to add privacy to a somewhat meaningful degree while making sure that my model somewhat fits the data still?.Performance differences.Confusion Matrix of Model without Differential Privacy added. It's not \"good\" but it's at least somewhat meaningful and the model reaches an accuracy of ~80%..Confusion Matrix of Model with Differential Privacy (epsilon: 2.3) after 100 epochs. It looks as if the model does not know what to do, at all..Possible explanations.I read a paper that stated that adding Differential Privacy can cause bad performance in the sense that the accuracy decreases for underpopulated classes. But, I used undersampling and I think this should've solved that, but the accuracy stays bad (for all classes!)..Maybe because my sample set is so small, differential privacy is much harder to achieve, and therefore the performance is bad? However, even if add a really tiny bit of privacy, with an epsilon value >20000, the model still struggles in learning how to classify. So I'm not sure.",

I don't want the seasonality of this period (march till now) to influence the seasonal factors for the upcoming years so I figured it might be a good idea to add a new seasonality to this period to avoid that.The problem that I find is that it seems as though the forecast chooses which seasonality to prioritize like a constant factor, where in reality it would make more sense for the forecast to gradually grow back to it's overall seasonality as the effect Covid has on sales is decreasing over time.

   "question_body": "I have noticed that the Stanford default entity mention tags don't merge with my new tags. For example; I want to find and tag telephone numbers. +1 234-567-8901 before my tags get run, Standford tags \"+1\" as \"NUMBER\" and \"234-567-8901\" also as \"NUMBER\" however, they remain as separate tags. I have tried creating my own TokensRegex rule to find these and mark them as \"TELEPHONE_NUMBER\". They are successfully changed to the new tag, but they remain separate tags..I have also noticed that this happens when tagging text and digits. Say if I wanted to tag \"my number is 234-567-8901\" then it would tag \"my number is\" as one tag and \"234-567-8901\" as a separate tag. I have tried using the B-TELEPHONE_NUMBER and I-TELEPHONE_NUMBER tags as mention in the documentation and it does remove the B and I, but they remain separate tags. I have noticed this behavior only happens with Stanford's tags. I have tested it with DATE and it does the same thing.So, my question is, how can I get Stanford's tags to merge with mine? If they can't be merged, is there a way to delete that tag and then add my own tag?.EDIT.here is another example of the tags not merging together..This snippet is suppose to catch covid 19.However, 19 is tagged as a NUMBER before this rule is run. it tags covid as CORONAVIRUS and changes 19's tag from NUMBER to CORONAVIRUS. It's suppose to then combine the two into one entity mention, but it doesn't. When it comes across corona virus, which is also separated into two tokens, it combines the two into one entity mention..EDIT 2.I decided to make a small pipeline to replicate the issue. I based it off the example found here https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/tokensregex.html I made modification to more closely replicate the one used in our pipeline. here is the function.Here is the output.As you can see the tags like COMPANY are merged into one mention when next to each other. However, like I mentioned above, covid 19 remains separate. This happens when a portion of the tokens already have a tag. In this case 19 was NUMBER.",

   "question_body": "If this question is better put in CrossValidated, let me know. Thought I'd start here, since it's primarily a question about a specific error, which happens to be in a machine learning algorithm, rather than a question about approaches or methods..I'm working on a machine learning project to forecast the number of deaths by US county from COVID on Kaggle. To tune the hyperparameters of the random forest regressor, I'm using sklearn's RandomizedSearchCV class, but fitting it throws a IndexError: positional indexers are out-of-bounds, though the traceback only references the pandas module. This does not happen when normally fitting the random forest regressor without the RandomizedSearchCV and using a simpler splitting method (no cross validation)..At first I thought it might be to do with the range of values that I passed to it, but I reduced the values for each parameter and all parameters, but get the same problem..My current suspicion is that it's in the custom cross validation class that I'm using to do a split on multiple time series (MultipleTimeSeriesSplit in the code), but it seems to work on the training data just fine. It doesn't work on the labels alone, since the splitting depends on the fips_target column in the features. Im not confident that this is the current issue either, since attempting to split the labels results in a missing column error, not a positional index error..What is causing this IndexError? How can I get it functioning?.The following code is for Kaggle, but if you're not on it, you should be able to download the necessary data set here..This minimal example does not include the functional fitting of the random forest regressor without cross validation, nor the other models that I'm testing out, nor the demographic data that I joined to the covid data..The existing answer does not address my error. I'm really not sure how to diagnose or make progress on this myself",

Second, I would like the labels to read vertically; but this only happens on the last of the plots.

Sample file I've built this application www.coronaviruscharts.net but I'm not sure my approach was the correct one. I parse the csv file and create individual files for each month, then load those files to a MySql database. My entity classes map to the individual month tables. I have a DAO for each month, and services to get data for each month. This means I have to create new entities and services for every month but the code is identical except for the entity I reference. For example, I have a JanuaryService, FebruaryService etc. The alternative seemed to be to avoid parsing the original file into individual months and loading the data to one table, but then I thought I would have to rebuild the application every day to add a new filed to account for the new day's data.",

I’m fine with everything..Last night was pretty late, and I did not realize I can get so many downvotes!.I am able to \"connect\" the YouTube Data API and OAuth 2.0 with my credentials. I am referring to the documentation of the former, which can be found here: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs.From my reading, I had found (and tried) rate and getRating methods under \"Videos\" section. Obviously they did not work since rate can be used when \"I\" upvote a video and getRating can only get a binary result (whether \"liked\" or not)..What I did with getRating.What I did with changing part argument.I do not have any data. The point of these is to collect some data in order to use later in R, which I am more familiar with..This is not my \"work\". I am doing a research on \"how covid 19 affect YouTube views\" sort of stuffs. I just want to find out if I can find anything interesting..I am sorry that I did not add enough information about what I was currently doing. I was too tried and stayed late yesterday.",

I've checked and installed all the dependencies mentioned (Chrome, Requests, nbconvert and Pillow - I have them all and working) but when I try to publish, I get the intermediate screen from medium and then on the final step when I hit the publish button I get the following error:.For some reason it cannot take a screenshot and render the cell outputs that are pictures or dataframes..Any other pictures that I've created manually to enhance the document (e.g. the logo of my article or others), are read properly and loaded, but any code generated ones (pandas, bar chart races, etc...) are not..1) I wonder if I've missing something else or has to do with the fact that I'm running Ubuntu under Windows Linux Subsystem and not native? i.e. it cannot take a screenshot via Chrome as it runs under windows?.i.e. when I run jupyter-notebook from ubuntu command line it still gives me a URL to run on windows but I also get the message: No web browser found: could not locate runnable browser., so I have to launch Jupyter manually on windows..Jupyter notebook command line.2) If that's the case, would that be the reason it can't take a screenshot of the output. Somewhere in the article it says:.\"Pandas DataFrames are converted to images Medium does not support tables, such as those produced in output cells by pandas DataFrames. As a workaround, these tables are uploaded as images captured by the Chrome browser’s screenshot ability. In the following code cell, the bar_chart_race package is used to import a pandas DataFrame containing deaths from COVID-19 in several countries. It is embedded in the Medium post as an image.\".I don't know how else to make this work, but any suggestions would be great as it seems to be a great tool?.Thanks Angelo.CORRECTION on Question 1 - I have now made that work by doing the following from this thread: https://stackoverflow.com/a/62275339/11141700 . So this wasn't the issue, as I'm still getting the same error when trying to publish on Medium with Pandas frames and plots in cells output.",

   "question_body": "The problem:.I need to read a row of values from an excel spreadsheet into a parameter array and use these values to set the initial values of stocks..The specifics:.a. I can successfully set the scalar parameters default values from excel using ExcelControlName.getCellNumericValue(\"ExcelSheetName\", RowNumber, ColumnNumber)..b. Trying to set default values for array parameters with ExcelControlName.readHyperArray(DestinationArrayName,\"ExcelSheetName\",RowNumber, ColumnNumber, false) returns a \"Cannot return a void result\" error on build..c. I can read the parameter arrays from a function called from the Agent actions \"On startup:\" section using ExcelControlName.readHyperArray(DestinationArrayName,\"ExcelSheetName\",RowNumber, ColumnNumber, false)..d. Stocks with their initial values set to the parameter array that was successfully loaded by the function are all zero even though the parameter array shows values (when run). Initial value: ParameterArrayName..e. When I set the parameter array values through the value editor the stocks initialize correctly..My suspicion:.I'm thinking that the issue has something to do with the internal timing within the entrails of the model generated by Anylogic such that the function to load the parameters is executed after the stocks get initial values - but that could just be the delirium caused by repeatedly smashing my forehead into the wall. But, if this is indeed the case, how can I sneak the function in earlier or, better yet, how would someone who actually knows what they're doing accomplish this?.What I'm trying to accomplish:.As a septuagenarian with lots of time on my hands and a vague recollection of dynamic modeling using Dynamo from a Systems Science program in the early seventies (and not used since), I thought I'd take a whack at age-based modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to see, among other things, whether establishing elder-prisons (in now vacant Club-Meds, Sandals... I'm sure) would be an economically advantageous strategy. Getting there requires dis-aggregating classic SIR approaches into age-specific chains of causality. So far, I'm at 27 age-specific parameters for eight age-groups and 24 scalar parameters. As much as I'd like to type and retype... all this data I'm really hoping there is a better way..I must say that I am amazed at how far modeling has come in only 50 or so years and I am enthralled with Anylogic's application - even though it's a bit java-ish for me..Thank you ever so much,.Carl Cottrell.Equivalent parameter arrays - one with values entered in edit the other read from excel file through a function",

   "question_body": "My goal is to use Python and its requests library to extract sequence data from the C3.ai Data Lake using its fetch API. Using the resulting JSON, I plan on using the pandas library to create a dataframe that stores a bunch of sequence meta-data from the BiologicalAsset objects, along with columns for the actual sequence, its length, and its sequenceType fields, which come from the Sequence object. This data is printed and is then moved to R for further viewing of the results. However, I am having trouble getting the data that I want from C3.ai and I am not sure why..In the code below, I specify that I am including the Biological Asset as well as the sequence child object, the length, and the sequence type. This is all working correctly because I am receiving a dataframe with all of the correct columns after I flatten the JSON with json_normalize(). I use the \"filter\": \"sequence.length >= 28900\", to filter out any sequences that are too short to be a complete genome. The problem is that I am only getting 105 results the fit this criteria and I know this is false because the NCBI Coronavirus data hub has almost 3000 sequences that it flags as complete. Futhermore, filtering for nucleotide sequences that have valid sequences in the child object using \"filter\": \"assetType == 'nucleotide sequence' && exists(sequence.sequence)\", yields the same result. Using \"filter\": \"exists(sequence.sequence)\", shows that there are only 1314 sequences of any type, including protein sequences, that actually have data in their child sequence object. Running these same searches using the sequence fetch API \"https://api.c3.ai/covid/api/1/sequence/fetch\" and the appropriate length and existence filters has given me the same numbers..Browsing a table I made using an sequence fetch I made to retrieve all possible sequences by using no filter, I found that the sequence objects themselves existed for probably all of the sequences I need, but that the actual sequence fields themselves are missing. Is this an issue with my approach or with the Data Lake?.Thanks for your help!.Link to NCBI COVID 19 hub.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/virus?VirusLineage_ss=Severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome%20coronavirus%202%20(SARS-CoV-2),%20taxid:2697049&SeqType_s=Nucleotide&Completeness_s=complete.Biological asset fetch code.Sequence fetch JSON with possible filters commented out.",

Currently I do this the long way.I tried to optimise the groupby call like this:-.But the error suggest the class doesn't support this.I thought I could use .agg({}) and supply dictionary.but that produces another error.I have plenty of other bits to optimise, I thought this python part would be the easiest and save a few ms!.Could anyone nudge me in the right direction?",

However, in the package documentation (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/EpiEstim.pdf) there is a point that I can't properly understand. The function \"discr_si\" (which computes the discrete distribution of the serial interval) assumes that the serial interval is shifted Gamma distributed, with shift 1. However, the input parameters are: k: positive integer, or vector of positive ingerers for which the discrete distribution is desired; mu: a positive real giving the mean of the Gamma distribution; sigma: a non-negative real giving the standard deviation of the Gamma distribution. My question is: should I consider mu as already shifted or should I consider mu without shift? I have a value for non shifted mu equal to 6.66 and I don't know whether use 6.66 or 7.66 (mu of shifted gamma with shift 1). In the source code (https://rdrr.io/cran/EpiEstim/src/R/discr_si.R) the Gamma parameter are computed as: a <- ((mu - 1) / sigma)^2 b <- sigma^2 / (mu - 1) so I think that it is possible that I have to use as input parameter \"mu+1\" (7.66).. but why asking for a shifted distribution when the code shift it back?

Tiles with the lightest red had 0% of their county's population with confirmed coronavirus cases on that particular day.

There is no such value in the source dataset, just thought it might be more in line with data visualization design principles if we could set the highest intensity colors to a value other than the maximum in the dataset..For example, it might be interesting to have the darkest red be set to the peak infection rate during the Spanish Flu..Thanks!.It might have something to do with the scale_fill_gradientn() function, but at most the transformations I've tried just have the darker red colors apply to more values from the dataset, which is kind of the opposite of what I'm looking for..Thanks!",

It's just subtracting that is giving me such a headache..Tried methods:.'DatetimeIndexResampler' object has no attribute 'diff'.ufunc() missing 1 of 2required positional argument(s).'Rolling' object has no attribute 'diff'.ufunc() missing 1 of 2required positional argument(s).Sample data:..Desired sample output:..Recreate sample data from original NYT dataset:.Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I need this in js, so I've converted it to the following code:.But this just returns.yet somehow Bertrand's code returns the proper data. What's even more interesting is that in Bertrand's code, the url it constructs (with the root and session id) leads to a \"Page not found\" page, and so does mine, yet Bertrand is able to get the data from that page, while I can't get data from my page..Does anyone know how to help?.Thanks.",

E.g, strings will have one, two, or three Patient IDs and no more so I could write a query that matches each separate case..I thought I could use regex to do this but now that I look at regex more carefully I think all it can do is tell me that such Patient IDs exist but unlike functions such as SUBSTR that will actually return part of the string that I want so I can bind it to a variable, regex just returns true or false that some string matches the pattern or it doesn't.

   "question_body": "I am trying to build a very simple Flutter app that shows the user four tiles. When the user clicks on one of the tiles, the app is supposed to open the URL in their browser that corresponds to that tile. For example, if the tile says \"YouTube\" then when that tile is pressed the app should take the user to YouTube. I have got something working but it doesn't work as intended. When you click on one of the tiles it doesn't take you to the desired website, it takes you to one of the other websites that I am trying to open within the app. For example, if you click on the tile that says Covid-19 Cases, the app opens Dr. John Campbell's YouTube Channel. I think my problem lies in the for loop in the _launchUrl method, but I am not sure how to fix it. I hope my explanation wasn't too long. I would appreciate suggestion from anyone, thank you all so much! I will attach the code and a screen shot of the app. I am not allowed to show pictures on my posts yet. I hope the URL isn't too much trouble.",

   "question_body": "So I am trying to match an employee's latitude and longitude to the lat-long of a covid containment zone. In my database, I have a table called 'employee' with the columns 'Row_index', 'Address', 'Employee_ID', 'Latitude' and 'Longitude', and a second table called 'red_zones' with the columns 'Location_index', 'Address', 'Latitude' and 'Longitude'..Now I have to match the Lat-Long of each employee in the table 'employee' to the Lat-Long of all containment zones in the table 'red-zones'. I decided to use a stored procedure by iterating through the 'red_zones' table:.After calling the procedure, I got the error 'maximum result count reached, no more results could be displayed'. I figured this was probably because the number of rows in the 'red_zones' table was over 700..So I decided to Iterate through the 'employee' table instead (26 rows):.This procedure did not give me any output at all. I have also made sure that there is a lat-long that matches between the two tables..Should I be looking to modify my procedures, and if so, in what way? Or should I be looking at a completely different method of achieving my goal?.Thanks.",

I cant figure out Why am I getting the wrong dates but the right Peak new covid cases for country..Link to the problem: https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/Window_LAG Problem #8.Here's my thought process..In this query we have to get the peak new cases for countries where at least 1000 new cases have been reported in a single day. In this case the confirmed column(here,confirmed is equal to new cases reported in a day plus the preceding day's cases) is arranged in cumulative manner. So to get new cases for each day I have made a subquery and within that query I PARTITIONED it by name and ORDERED it by confirmed(new cases,cumulative) from least to most and then subtracted the preceding row in the current partition. Which would then give me the table in pure new cases per day form. After that in the main query i have GROUPED the table by name(here,name is country) and then selected the groups with at least 1000 cases reported and finally ordered it by date as seen in the expected result..Dont know where i went wrong. Everything seems like it should work..My Query..Expected.Got.Hope I gave all the necessary details.",

The RecyclerView in Fragment 1 is relatively smaller(contains about 35 elements) but the RecyclerView in Fragment 2 contains a list of about 200 countries..As I start my app, I want both these RecyclerViews to be loaded..The task is simple : Call the API->Parse the JSON->Update the Adapter-> Set the Adapter to the RecyclerView..Problem : The app UI freezes(for about 10 seconds) as I start the app..I searched in Stack Overflow and in Youtube and what I did until now is to Create a MyASyncTask which calls the API(for Fragment 2) in background and updates the RecyclerView..Some Side Notes of the above Code:.Example_Item is a class which represents each list Item of the RecyclerView. CovidData_Countries is a class which parses the JSON. It has a public data member arr[](of type Example_Item) which stores all objects of Items that goes into the RecyclerView..What I want my app to work Like : As I open my App, The Fragment 1 RecyclerView will immediately load up(which actually does, it takes about 0.5 seconds) and I want the RecyclerView in Fragment 2 to load up gradually(without causing app UI to freeze up). By gradually I mean Item-By-Item if it is difficult to load all at once..I thought after adding the MyAsyncTask class, the app UI won't freeze up, but it does freeze..It might happen that my MyAsyncTask is completely wrong. In that case, it will be really helpful if you could show me the correct way to implement it in background..My Adapter Code:.}",

   "question_body": "I have 2 heatmaps I'm trying to join together, one contains week over week data and the other contains 6W/YTD information. I keep them separate so their colors aren't skewed..When they're put together in a subplot, the yaxis label on the right is the first row label on the left..I would like to remove that yaxis label, and have tried by means of fig.update_yaxes(title=''/None/False), also the title_text argument, I've also tried accessing it via fig['layout']['scenes']['yaxis2']['title'] = ''/None/False. Seems like a lot of resources (including official documentation) show how to change a single figure, as could be demonstrated with my code via.which unfortunately doesn't carry over when fig2 is added to the subplot. I'm not sure how this assignment is happening. I've reviewed the JSON structure and see no assignment, I've also dug through the structure in their documentation to see if there was something I could override or set. Can someone help me figure out how to hide the fig2 yaxis label? Might be more accurate to ask how one would set this manually, but nonetheless..*edit* I've taken a closer look at the annotations. The figures annotations are set with this bit.these are based on.which are just 2d arrays of integers. checking the annotations in each figure for 'A', the Figure they're added to as subplots is the only one that contains the 'A'.based on that, this could easily be \"solved\" retroactively by overwriting the annotation like so.this works, but feels very finicky and I would still like to know how this is supposed to be done with plotly. This approach feels like it could have unintended effects depending on application..Upon closer inspection I'm also realizing there are no annotations placed on the first 2 columns of the bottom row despite them having annotations in their original figure.I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing or if it's my approach that's incorrect in setting annotations.I'll leave it as is because this post is becoming cumbersome, but there's a problem: 1) with the annotations and 2) the y title for fig2; I feel like they have to be related though I don't know how this is occurring.I've separated my code below, a Paste is available here..imports.data prep.plot_prep.creating and joining the figures",

As such, I simply stop the model from running lest my computer explode into flames..Some IT folks that I know said that they can create an instance in Azure to run these scripts, which would give me significantly more computing power, but they need to know how much CPU and RAM I need. Can anybody help me out with this? I only need to run the model one time, for example to recreate the Oregon chart, rather than all 50 charts as shown on the website.

   "question_body": "I am working with Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID19 data, published on their GitHub. Some of the metrics they publish in their daily US reports are sum aggregations. I would like to perform basic math against the values within a given field so that I can get a daily tally..JHU publishes their data daily, so let's assume that the numbers reported reflect a 24-hour period..Example: In the State of New York, I can see the following values for Last_Update and Recovered, where Recovered is a rolling sum of all cases where people have recovered from infection:.Ideally, I would like to create a new field (be it a scripted field, or a new field that is generated via a Logstash Filter processor) called RecoveredToday, where the field value reflects the difference between today's Recovered aggregation and yesterday's Recovered aggregation..In the above data set, RecoveredToday is calculated from the value of Recovered on 2020-08-05 minus the value of Recovered on 2020-08-04..With respect to using a Scripted Field in Kibana, according to this blog article, Scripted Fields can only analyze fields within one given document at a time, and cannot perform calculations against a field across multiple documents..I do see user @agung-darmanto solved a similar problem on StackOverflow, but the solution calls out specific dates rather than performing rolling calculations. It's also unclear from the code snippet if the results are being inserted into a new field that can subsequently be used to build visualizations..The approach to use Logstash ruby processing on the fly also presents a problem. Logstash, as far as I know, cannot access an already ingested document ... and if it can, it's probably a pretty ugly superpower to wield..Goal: There are other fields provided in the JHU CSSE data which are also pre-aggregated. I would like to produce visualizations that reflect trends such as:.Using the data they provide, I can build visualizations that will plateau, and that plateau reflects a reduction of incidences. I'm trying to produce visualizations that show ZERO.",

   "question_body": "Part of graph is cropped out when saving.I am trying to combine two separate plots: a first one is a linechart with two unrelated y axis, and is built using base R plot() commands (I read that ggplot2 does not support unrelated secondary y-axis: am I correct?). The second graph is again a linechart, this time with a single y-axis. For the sake of internal consistency, also this graph is built using base R plot() commands..In order to combine the two graphs, I am saving them as two separate objects, using recordPlot(), which I store for combining them in a single column graph using plot_grid() with the parameter ``ncol = 1''. The two graphs taken separately look (almost) as I would like them to be. When I Zoom-in the plotting device, or try to save the combined graph, the bottom axis and part of the upper graph are cropped out..The data for a reproducible example is reported using dput() at the end of the post..Code and system info.The first plot looks fine..The second plot also looks fine:..The problem emerges when I try to combine and export the two graphs as a single column plot_grid() output.In this case, there is a difference in how the combined graph looks like in the plotting device of RStudio, and the output from ggsave() / save_plot(), as I show with the two images below..SUMMARY.I guess my problem might be related to the way I define the margins, but I could not solve this issue. I tryed to play around with par() as well as with the plot_grid() parameters, but I could not solve the discrepancies between what I can see in RStudio and what I get when saving the graph. Do you have any Idea for what is going on? Is it possible that part of the problem relates to the way I build the graph? I would love to use ggplot() rather that plot() (that I think would make it easier to combine plots) but I could not find a way to include an unrelated secondary y-axis. Is there any workaround for this?.DATA",

The problem is, when I select Brazil, Mexico or United States. It shows that it will never end. I am curious about the reason.

I know the limitations of the work. For example, new case number is bound to the number of tests etc. Please ignore those limitations. I'd like to see what is needed to produce a result out of the following code..Here are some outputs:.Spain (Expected Output Example).Turkey (Expected Output Example).France (Expected Output Example).USA (Unexpected Output Example).Brazil (Unexpected Output Example).I suspect something that cause gamma(the rate of recovering) parameter too small which leads the same amount of cases for each day.

And I ended up running these files by importing them in a certain order(Don't know If that was the best way). So here is where I ran into an error. I don't exactly know if this error is because of how I imported my files or my tkinter code is just wrong. I just couldn't seem to click on a button twice. I would run my program and click on a button, it would run properly and then the next time I clicked on that same button It would just not work. There was no error and no output. Nothing would happen. Here is my code:.So my question and problem is: Why can I not click on a button more than twice? This has happened to me before and I could not fix it.

I retrieved NYT covid data by county level and statistical data from food agency, so I want to understand how covid cases are surging in counties where major food processing plants are located.

However, I found issues of getting the right plotting data for that because the resulted plot is not getting the expected output. Here is what I tried so far:.my attempt:.Here is the final aggregated covid time series data that I am interested in this gist. Here is my current attempt:.but looks I made the wrong aggregation above, this attempt is not working. My intention is basically if a company has multiple establishments (a.k.a est), then I need to take sum of its num-emp: # of employees, then get the ratio of # of new_deaths / num-emp along the time. Basically I want to track whether company's staff are affected by covid or not with some approximate sense. I am not quite sure what would be the correct way of doing this with matplotlib in python. Can anyone suggest possible of correction to make this right? Any idea?.second attempt.I got some inspiration from recent covid19 related post, so this is another way of trying to do what I want to make in matplotlib. I aggregated data in this way with custom plotting helper function also:.then this is plotting helper function that I came up:.but I trapped again here how to make this right. My essential goal is basically whether how much meat processing companies are affected by covid because if its worker got infected by covid, companies' performance will be dropped. I want to make eda that provides this sort of information visually. Can anyone suggest possible ways of doing this with matplotlib? I am open to any feasible eda attempt that makes this question more realistic or meaningful..desired output.I am thinking about to make eda output something like below:..what I want to see, by county level, how every company's performance is varied because of covid. Can anyone point me out anyway to achieve possible eda output?

   "question_body": "I am interested in how the COVID pandemic is affecting meat processing plants across the country. I retrieved NYT COVID data by county level and statistical data from the food agency. Here I am exploring how COVID cases are surging in counties where major food processing plants are located because more sick employees in plants might bring negative impacts to the business. In my first attempt, I figured out moving average time series plots where COVID new cases vs 7 days rolling mean along the date..But, I think it would be more efficient I could replace the graph which represents num-emp and new-cases by counties in the for loop. To achieve this, I think it would be better to cluster them by company level and expand them into multiple graphs to prevent the lines from overlapping and becoming to difficult to see. I am not sure how to achieve this from my current attempt. Can anyone suggest a possible ways of doing this in matplotlib? Any idea?.my current attempt:.Here is the reproducible data in this gist that I used in my experiment:.import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.dates as mdates import seaborn as sns from datetime import timedelta, datetime.here is my current output:..but this output is not quite significant to understand how food processing company' is affected by COVID because of infected employees. To make this more visually accessible to understand, I think we can replace the two graphs with num-emp and newly infected case new_cases and draw the counties we need in the loop process. At that point, it would be better to cluster them by company characteristics, etc. and expand them into multiple graphs to prevent the lines from overlapping and becoming difficult to see. I want to make EDA that provides this sort of information visually. Can anyone suggest possible ways of doing this with matplotlib? Any thoughts? Thanks!",

   "question_body": "I have been studying R for a few months. I have been using Covid-19 data from the NYTimes (NY Times Covid Data on Github) as a test data set for learning about statistical programming..From their Github repository, you can get the case data for the US as a whole, by state, or by county. Whichever one you are looking at, there is a cumulative total for the number of known cases and the number of deaths for each location and each date. A location doesn't show up in the data set until there is at least one case or death, and then once there it gets updated every day in perpetuity..My goal is to come up with a way to do calculations for new cases since yesterday, new cases since last week, etc and add these calculations as new columns to my dataframe. I have found a strategy that works with smaller sets of data but gets pretty slow when dealing with nationwide data at the county level..I will generate some random data to use as an example..So first I tried to reverse engineer the cumulative sum. I have not been able to successfully produce what I want..And I needed more flexibility than just figuring out the daily new cases anyway. A lot of the epidemiology models are based on comparing the known cases or deaths today to the known cases or deaths a week ago, or ten days ago, or three weeks ago, or whatever..I built some for loops that worked okay, but the code was clunky and error-prone. And so I came up with this strategy using sapply with the sum function, bracket sub-setting, and binary relational operators. Coming from Excel world, this is basically an approximation of SUMIFS..This works great and I can do all kinds of calculations playing off of this theme. New cases per day, new cases per week, per month. I can calculate a proxy for known active cases by taking the difference between the known cases today and the known cases from n days ago. Subtract the deaths from that and you have a good proxy for known recovered cases in a given area. Substitute the sum function for mean and you can do all kinds of rolling averages. Add some population data and you do it all on a per capita basis. And the subsetting is really powerful for looking at a particular region or metropolitan area or for comparing different locations based on demographic/mobility variables from other data sets. So I am mostly pretty happy with my progress, especially at the national and state levels..However, when you start getting down to the county level it gets pretty slow as the datasets get pretty huge. Did you know there are 254 counties in Texas alone? And a lot of times the daily updates revise past numbers. Obviously, I can just schedule it to run over night or split the data up into smaller chunks, etc. But I'm interested mostly just to understand the mechanics of wrangling huge time series datasets efficiently..So TLDR; is there a computationally faster method to do these calculations in a dataset with millions of rows?.And as secondary questions, people often mention data.table for very large datasets, would this be a good application for that package and what would the syntax look like? I haven't figured out how to do it without relying on the same sapply trick and then it's probably not any faster. Or are there time-series packages for R that do this kind of thing well already whose code I could examine for pointers?.Thank you.If it matters, I'm running RStudio 4.0.2 on Windows10. And I do most of my wrangling with base R and dplyr.",

My project regards validation of Community Acquired Pneumonia Scores in a Retrospective Cohort, however, for this question, I will create a simulated data-set..Suppose I have 3 predictor variables (hemoglobin, creatinine and sex) which are continuous, continuous and binary respectively and the outcome is death which is also binary outcome..And suppose there is a model out there that says that points for hemoglobin, creatinine and sex to predict death. It assigns 1 point if male, 2 points if hemoglobin less or equal to 12 and 3 points if creatinine greater or equal to 1. I then calculate the respective score in R and will have the outcome in numbers from 0 to 6 maximum. I have the also the outcome of those patients, however, I have a scale in points and not probabilities. How can I test the calibration of this model?.The simplest way that comes to my mind is fitting it a logistic model (eg. glm(data = outcome, death ~ score)) and then using for example the function calibrate from rms package to plot it. However, I'm concerned that fitting a logistic regression model would 'train' and overfitt the model to my data (slope would be 1 and intercept 0). A second way of doing that would be going after the original paper where they validated the score and getting their predicted death rates by each level of score. However, I dont think people would actually do that..Here goes the code..To make things easier for understanding, my problem is validating the PSI (Pneumonia Severity Assessment) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. However, my PSI score ranges from 1-5 only..Thanks in advance.",

I seem to be experiencing the same problem as the poor soul in this thread: https://forums.iis.net/t/1240175.aspx..NOTE: I posted this earlier today on Superuser - I realized there is a large base of IIS-tagged questions on SO so thought I'd also post here..OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit 2004 19041.508.Problem: Basically, IIS will not serve static content over a certain arbitrary size - static files over that size will just timeout eventually. Non-static content, for example asp files do not have this limit and load as expected regardless of size. This started happening seemingly out of nowhere with no directly related IIS/system/network/permission changes..Things I've Tried:.Details:.About a 1 or 1.5 months ago my local IIS stopped working, out of the blue. By out of the blue I mean the the previous day it was working fine as always and the next it stopped - without having done any system changes whatsoever. By stopped working I mean (eventually realized) that it was only static files that were not serving correctly. Unfortunately/fortunately, I noticed the problem because I had created the obligatory personal COVID tracker. It was html/js running against a .NET API back end. The pages stopped loading and I spent time wondering what I had borked in the code (which I also hadn't touched). Eventually I realized no static content - images, css, js, html, txt etc. - was loading properly. I ran some tests and I found that there was a cutoff point in size of content that would load, but it is somewhat arbitrary. For example, the iisstart.png image in the default IIS website does not load - it's 97K. I replaced it with an 8k file that loads fine. I could get about 1500 bytes served in an html file - 1501 bytes would send it off the rails but 1500 worked. Same sort of thing was found for text files although I was able to send more than 1500 bytes - don't remember how much but did find a point where a 1 byte difference caused a problem..Test Load of Default IIS Website:.IIS log is not helpful - it reports the failed attempt as a 200 but says it took 19 seconds. It is returning a win32 status code of 121 though:.The tracing mostly doesn't fire I guess because the 200 is eventually returned?.Fiddler gives me this for the image request:.For this site the actual html loads fine - it's only 696 bytes - the image it references does not though (97K)..If anybody can shed some light on this or give me a direction in troubleshooting I would greatly appreciate it..Thanks",

Just to name a quick few, resetting using sns.set(), sns.set_style(), sns.restore_defaults(). I have also tried resetting matplot settings to defaults as well. This attribute persists across all my files, so I cant even open a new file, delete the line of code that caused it, or run any past programs, or it will apply to those graphs too. My seaborn version is 0.10.1, I have tried to update it, but I cant get it to go through. I am using anaconda's spyder IDE The documentation says for versions after 0.8 that the styles/themes must be invoked to be reset, but if I try to use their solution sns.set_theme() I get an error saying that this module has no attribute.

I have created an example dataset of what one policies values might look like for one country. If the policies value is 0, then there is no active policy. The policy is active if it ranges from 1-5 and the scale of the policy increases as it gets larger..So the problem i had was i wanted to subset all the start and end dates of the policies so i could later plot them as labels. I managed to accomplish this using a column with lagged values and one with lead values. Using these, i was able to detect when a policy \"turned on\" by checking if the previous value was any value other than the policy value. I did the same for the policy end but with the lead value this time..My question is simply that i wanted to know if anyone knew of a more efficient way of doing this, Thank you..Edit: Changed some variable names and added in the output for the label policy start/end variables..Created on 2020-09-16 by the reprex package (v0.3.0)",

Why is the jQuery on Change function triggering twice? ; while testing and running, i see the alerts \"position A\" and \"image PASS\" alerted twice. Why are these triggering twice? Its not creating a problem, but i would like to know..Q2. Also, whats the best way to Display and Hide the IMG_PREVIEW element? If I use attr('visibility','visible'/'hidden' it still shows the footprint of the IMG_PREVIEW element (it has CSS height and width). is it advisable to use $('# ')css('display','flex'/'block') and $('# ')css('display','none') to show hide elements?

   "question_body": "Problem description: I have PDF files in a S3 Bucket called \"cases\". I need to loop through all these PDFs, read each, and select PDFs based on keywords. The PDFs that contain the specified keywords need to be store in the \"confirmed-covid19\" bucket. Those PDFs without the specified keywords will be stored in the \"no-covid\" bucket..Error: \"ValueError: Filename must be a string.\".Narrative: I ran the code in chunks to identify errors. The code shown below works above Line 37. The error is related to the code written below Line 37. My understanding is that the function 'upload_file' only take strings for the Filename and Key parameters. How can fix this issue, and put the selected PDFs containing keywords in the \"confirmed-covid19\" bucket? and the rest in the \"no-covid\" bucket? I still want to keep the original name of each PDF file. What is the most efficient way to achieve this task? Also, all suggestions to improve the code are welcome.",

Update the question so it can be answered with facts and citations by editing this post..Closed 27 days ago..I am working with the R programming language. Suppose I have a dataset which describes the business relationships between a group of grocery stores and their customers. In this example:.The code to generate some sample data looks like this:.From here, I am not sure if the next steps are logical. In normal circumstances, the \"nodes\" in the graph would all be of the same \"type\" - e.g. all the nodes would be \"customers\". In my example, the nodes are either \"customers\" or \"stores\". In my view, on some level this is like \"comparing apples to oranges\" : even though the graph is describing business relationships between customers and stores, a store is significantly different, \"bigger and stronger\" than an individual customer. I am not sure if it makes sense to create a graph in which all the nodes are not homogenous..Here is the graph that is created - I made the nodes corresponding to \"stores\" significantly larger to display the inherent difference between a \"customer\" vs a \"store\":..If this graph makes logical sense, I am then interested in performing clustering (\"community detection\") on this graph in order to find interesting sub-networks :..If such a graph can be logically constructed, I hope clustering algorithms (e.g. fastgreedy, louvain, girvan-newman) can be performed on this graph and \"highly connected\" clusters can be identified which can be used to determine which stores/customers are at risk of getting COVID-19..Can someone please tell me if this idea makes sense : can a graph be constructed where the nodes are not all of the same \"type\"?

   "question_body": "I've been trying to just extract and scrape the number of COVID cases off of a website and display them on an index.html page, using puppeteer to scrape the data from the official COVID website. I have this code for my API in my index.js file:.The function \"scrapeCases\" is in a file called scrapers.js in the same directory as index.js. It returns the jsonValue() of the number I'm trying to extract from the COVID website (number of cases), which in reality gives me a Promise return value, which is why I also used toString() to change that..When I do console.log(myFinal) as given, the proper number of cases is shown in the terminal as if it were a regular string. But when I do res.send(myFinal), it doesn't show up in my index.html page, but if I comment res.send(myFinal) and do res.send('6') as an arbitrary example, the 6 is displayed (after a short delay of time, not sure why). Why is it that it doesn't work with res.send?.Also, if I do this instead:.Here I add \"await\" to my func.ScrapeCases statement since I think this is another way I can get the value of the Promise of numC. Again, the console.log(myFinal) gives me the proper amount of cases as a simple number with commas in between (e.g. 1,366,234), and res.send('6') again displays on my index.html if I uncomment it, but res.send(myFinal) does not display anything..Any help is appreciated thank you!",

The code shown below works above Line 37. The error is related to the code written below Line 37. My understanding is that the function 'upload_file' only take strings for the Filename and Key parameters. How can fix this issue, and put the selected PDFs containing keywords in the \"confirmed-covid19\" bucket? and the rest in the \"no-covid\" bucket? I still want to keep the original name of each PDF file. What is the most efficient way to achieve this task? Also, all suggestions to improve the code are welcome.",

Does this can cause some information loss if the data is huge ? i.e if I have 15 records in the column it makes sense to have this binary split but If Have 1000's of records I think using many threshold will make more sense..also the difference between the data is huge, it doesnt make sense to have only threshold for example if I have data of impact of COVID-19 on person per age. If I have a binary split on the based on 1 threshold this will cause information lost even if this threshold will give the highest information gain..Thank you",

My current project is a twitter bot that scrapes a government website for the latest COVID-19 case counts in my jurisdiction and tweets them out, building off this awesome tutorial..Functionally it is working, but I want to finesse it so that it only posts when that data is updated and new. Otherwise, it’s just an account that posts the same information every day rather than a news account..I thought the built-in rules in the Twitter API that don’t allow duplicate tweets would work automatically to filter out old information. Sometimes it does work, but the rule isn’t strict enough- it appears the account can still post duplicates as long as it doesn’t do it too often. Ideally, I’d like to make it more strict in my code. It would need to compare the new text to the last tweet, and only tweet if there was a difference in the text..Can anyone give me some guidance on if this is possible, and how best to get it done?

To do so , I would like to do a curvefit with the function scipy.optimize.curve_fit to find the correct parameters. But the problem I have is that I need those parameters to solve numerically those differential equations.

   "question_body": "There is an API (COVID-19 data to be exact) which posts data every other day more or less at the same time of day (3:30pm, 3:27pm, 3:38pm: 3:58pm, 4:23pm, etc.).I want to determine the ideal time to retrieve data with the least amount of network calls possible - so polling every 5 minutues is off limits. I want to use data from the past: So when I poll every hour and in the last X days I realized that new data will be posted between 3pm and 5pm, I do not want to poll outside of that range in the future (occasially checking for new data outside that range is okay, so I'm not ending in a too narrow range somethime in the future). Although I want to narrow down the range where I poll for new data as much as possible..I'm thinking of an algorithm similar to binary search where I split the time intervall between past new data timestamps with safety polls outside of that range so I end with something like a sliding window..In addition, I think it is possible to determine a kind of gradient that specifies in which period how often new data is checked for. (i.e. checking every minute from 3:25pm-3:50pm, checkin every 5mins from 3:30pm-3:25pm and 3:50pm-4:30pm, otherwise check every hour)..I wonder if someone smarter than me already did come up with an elegant solution for that problem.",

What am I doing wrong?.!DETAILS!\nAfter a few years I made about 30 gaming videos (130GB) and with the current covid-19 situation I started recording my online classes (about 40 videos or 150GB). Now because I'm lacking space on my 1TB external HDD I started getting into ffmpeg. Before I was only using obs-studio and not good parameters for recording..I was using CBR mode for recording, either 5000KB or 15000KB bit rate with varying x264 presets and profiles because I was also experimenting with them. Usually superfast preset with high profile. So I wanted to convert all those videos with ffmpeg using CRF 23, medium preset and high profile. A note that when I'm recording with obs-studio it's set to record in matroska format (.mkv)..When I was rendering my online classes videos with these settings I managed to achieve 10x better compression with the same quality. And when rendering my gaming videos I managed to achieve up to 3x better compression with the same quality. However there is this one video that when rendered with the same parameters the file size increases..The EE1.mkv should be recorded with CBR 15000KB bit rate, with superfast preset and high profile. Also the game that is recorded in this video is Empire Earth which needs around 8000KB for it to look good. Everything more than 8000KB is not needed..Thank you all for your help.",

I'm not sure why that is the case, and when I click on a specific marker the state array is unchanged..This is my git repo if you need the full code: https://github.com/ktanojo17505/google-map-react.Here is my state:.This is my constructor:.This is my return.MapwithMarker.clickHospital.This is the output of my code (before clicking Hospitals)1.This is the output of my code (after clicking Hospitals)2.If anyone could point out what I'm doing wrong that would be helpful thank you!",

   "question_body": "My php Curl request(also curl command in terminal) unfortunately shows a different code than opening the URL manually in the browser..Here is my problem: I want to display the currently available films from https://reservierung.kinolambach.at/filmlist/?location_id=1 (german cinema) on my website. When you check your network tab, the website sends an ajax call to a url with the specific date to the server and gets a response. Try it out by calling https://reservierung.kinolambach.at/filmlist/?location_id=1&date=4.1.2021&film_table=true in your browser(due to Covid there is a test film available on 4. Jan 2021).My website does not run on the same domain..Using an ajax call did not work because of CORS-Policy, so my second approach is to load the data via curl from php..Here is my php code, which does not work. For every request I make I get the result \"No film available on this day\". It seems as if \"No film available on this day\" (german: 'Für diesen Tag ist kein Programm verfügbar.') is the \"default\" response..There are several curl_setopt which I tried out, none did work..Here is my question How is it possible, that curl shows a different result than calling the url in the browser? You can even try it in your terminal with curl https://reservierung.kinolambach.at/filmlist/?location_id=1&date=1.1.2021&film_table=true How can I change this? I guess it has to do with the header..Thanks in advance and all the best!",

I begin to understand what a data service is..I also have my own service for my Author and Book classes to use. I name my service ImportService. I have methods in the ImportService to clean up my book data read from a CSV file before the Data Service saves my books to the database. I also follow the instruction to make the Data Service an Abstract Class. So, I can put my own method in the Data Service..Since the Author has its own AuthorService, and the Book has its own BookService, I want the different Data Service to access the method in my ImportService. So, I don't have to copy and paste the import CSV code multiple times. So, I put the line ImportService importService in the AuthorServie class and the BookService class. That does not go well. importService is always NULL inside the Data Service classes. I google the problem. They say I cannot inject another service to the grails.gorm.services.Service..There is a post that says to make a bean. I am new to Grails. I have no idea what they are talking about even with the codes posted. Part of my background is Assembly Language, C, and Pascal. My head is filled with lingo like Top Down, Subroutine, library, Address, and Pointer. I have no idea what a Bean is..This is what it is.

I'm currently trying to make a database to track people that are in quarantine due to potential exposure to COVID-19. I have the input stuff down but I need help with tallying up the numbers to get the output that we need. I can't access this site at work and I'm working off of memory at home so please bear with me. The part where I'm consistently getting errors is with a line similar to:.TallyRecordset![Contractor Pos not Hos] = 0.I'm getting an error that I think is saying that its not defined but again I'm going off of memory and I think it was error 3021. I've tried coming at this from several different ways already using nesting if/then statements (because the above would look a contractor that had tested positive but was not hospitalized so its not a straight count) and having the tally go directly to the table that I made for tallies with the fields as numbers and it didn't work. So then I thought that creating an integer variable and making those equal to the fields in the table that I changed to strings would fix the issue but I got the same error. After googling the problem for a couple of days and getting no solutions that make sense to me I'm not even sure that I'm going about this the right way. I'm guessing that I have to do something with queries but I have no idea. Thanks for taking the time to read this and for any input that you have..Edit: The error that I get is:.Run-time error '3021': No current record..

I have set up 10 identical blocks with 119 questions each (from 2023-17, to 17-17). If participants get the answer wrong, they are asked to start over from 2023 by moving to the following block (until they reach block 10, after which they'll just advance to the rest of the survey). If they get an answer right, the following question comes up as display logic. If they get all answers right, they advance to the rest of the survey..However, this task is meant to last for 5 minutes, so I am looking for a timer that can start on block trial 1, and auto-advance respondents to a selected block (without making participants go through trials 2-10) after the 5 minutes have elapsed. So essentially, a multi-block timer (= same timer over 10 blocks)..The Q_TotalDuration only works between blocks, and not within (participants would have to get to the end of the trial to advance). Tried getting participants to time themselves, but I can't find a way to add a button that will skip specific blocks for participants to press once they've realised they spent 5min+ on the task..I've seen some multipage Qualtrics timers, but none regarding multiblock timers. Can someone help, please?.I know this is a pretty complex task (especially for someone who is not familiar at all with Javascript like me) but really have no choice as the task was adapted due to covid.

I have installed all necessary tools as on my host machine in the VM, especially Python 3.8, Selenium, ChromeDriver and Google Chrome (the configuration file is called scripts/configure.sh)..The main (and only script) src/main.py works well on my local machine, as it fills the form and downloads it in a specific folder. But it seems that on the VM, the download does not happen..The options I have put so far for my webdriver are :.I also have set all directories to chmod 777 in case it is a permission problem, as I saw it could be a common thing.\nI have no errors, which mean it succeeds to perform all form fillings (I was first thinking about a the final form not being complete). I also tried to locate the downloaded file somewhere, but it is nowhere to be found.\nFinally, I also tried it interactively with a terminal console locally, and it also works fine..It worked at some point ! First only at once, and then all the times with embedded arguments instead of JSON files. So to use it on my phone and share it with friends, I just added the fact that my python script takes the information to fill as an input :.So it could be that python WebElement.sendKeys(...) works differently now ? I have tried to back up but could not make it work again, it has to come from the VM config somehow but I also tried to reboot the VM or to create a new one and it still did not work..So if any of you ran into the same problem and found a magical solution for this problem, I'd be happy to know !",

   "question_body": "I create a lot of instructional videos for my job. Some of them have me talking for 30+ min. while recording my screen as I demonstrate something. So I end up with dozens and dozens of .mp4 video files. I've recently been asked to create a transcript of each video that can be used as a \"closed caption\" to satisfy the ADA (American Disabilities Act) for the hearing impaired. I looked into pretty much every commercially available transcription solution to see about having all these videos transcribed. I've also looked into all seven of the open-source or free solutions like Google's Cloud Speech, IBM Watson's speech recognition... etc. and to quickly get to the point... all the commercially available solutions (DeScript, Audiate) all carry a fee (naturally). The company I work for has been hit by COVID pretty hard, so we are on total lockdown for new purchases and licenses. All the free and open source services only allow really small files that my 30 min. long videos dwarf. So I set out to see about creating a solution using Python. I found the SpeechRecognition package... and that lead me to find Carnegie Mellon's Pocketsphinx open source speech recognition toolkit. I was elated when I was able to get it all working, and I ran my first Transcription, and it worked!!! I did have to convert the .mp4 to a .wav file for it to work. And... the transcription isn't really all that great. If you think Siri's \"talk to text\" service makes mistakes... the transcript that resulted from my .WAV transcription was very... in the ballpark... but not perfect by any means. But, hey... I'll take it. It is a whole lot easier to scan and fix a .txt transcript than it is to sit and literally dictate it by hand..My question is... the transcripts that result from the Pocketsphinx solution have no capitalization, punctuation, or any sense of grammer. They are just a flat-out .txt file with a bunch of words that I have to go back and add punctuation too..Can any of you maybe point me in the direction of some way to either improve the transcription, or reprocess the resulting .txt file to insert some basic punctuation? I am barely literate with Python, so everything I've read online that has invoked concepts like machine learning and AI, are all way over my head.

We are using Google's API to find top search results. However, we have found that there are inconsistent results when using different search parameters within the API query. The inconsistencies are an issue because we are trying to hone our query to a certain error rate (error rate being how many URLs provide effective research information). We are looking for someone to help explain how Google's API works, because the documentation is extremely minimal. An example of our base query: 'https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1?key=KEY&cx=SEARCHENGINE&q=\"School Name\" intext:(term1 | term2 | term3) -inurl:(unwanted1 | unwanted2 | unwanted3) inurl:(wanted1 | wanted2 | wanted3)&start=1'.Where \"School Name\" is the name of a higher-ed institution. Term1, term2, etc., are specific variables that we want to find in the body text of the search results. The intext parameter helps to avoid invisible text in certain documents. For example, insidehighered.com includes many higher-ed institutions in invisible text without the actual article being applicable. Unwanted 1, etc,. are words or phrases that we don't want included in the URL title. For example, we want to avoid PDF documents, so one could be \".pdf\". Wanted1, etc,. are words that we do want in the URL, like \"news\". We use \"|\" to signify \"or\", which allows us to utilize one query for multiple types of searches, thus helping to minimize the cost of our API usage..So far, we've found the following issues/inconsistencies:.Our code being used to pull the items off of each page is:.Thank you!",

I can also goto webserver2.abc.com:8080 and it comes up fine..When I am off site (not on the work network), I get the:.If I look from the web-firewall (where I believe a request should first come in) there is no entry in the access_log of anyone even trying to hit the sight. I can hit other ones like weather.abc.com and it shows the entries from my IP etc. So it is like it is not even making it to the apache portion on the web-firewall for any requests for the covid19.abc.com website. I am not sure where else to look..The conf files on the webfirewall for my covid site are: (I don't need that authentication portion if you are offsite/network so I didn't add that)..site-covid19.conf.site-covid19-ssl.conf.Then on the webserver the config is:.000-site-covid19.conf.Though again I get that error from the browser and nothing in the only log I know to check (/etc/httpd/access_log) Is there somewhere else to look or test to even see if apache is picking up the request to covid19.abc.com (works when VPNed or on site itself) just not when off site..(I realize I am asking for certs and I know since I don't have any yet the browser should just bark at me and I can accept and move on...but wanted to get the 'basic' part done first). I am just out of ideas on what to try or look for next..Since I know the django app is working and running, and I also copied the configs for another website that was running and working I am at a loss as to why it doesn't work at all. I wish I even got an error as to why but nothing. I can grep log files on both servers for covid19 and it never shows like a request even came in for that or anything.",

   "question_body": "Good morning :).I have some questions regarding an icecast-setup. We have my own (Nextcloud)-Server sitting in our church. This works perfectly fine and since here in Germany the community services got forbidden already once during all this Covid19-stuff, we want to have a stream-setup. I managed to set up an icecast-instance on our server and we use my old laptop with Rocket Broadcaster and a Steinberg CI2 to provide the source for the stream. That works all as intended. We already used it once because we stopped public services for two weeks after one of our member got tested positive after he went abroad for a week. Our operator on the PA doesn't want to have another display there, which would disturb him from listening the sermon..My project regarding this: I have a RPi4 and a Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD. The input atm is a standard mic, that is connected to the Interface. The Pi is configured with darkice and uses its own icecast installation, while I am testing everything at home. Since I started the streaming project, after the service we switched Rocket Broadcaster to use VLC and a folder of old service recordings (mastered and in MP3-format) to provide a source to listen while we are at work or on travels. This option gets used pretty regularly and I want to keep it going. My plan is to have a little box with a LED levelmeter, where the input level is shown. That should be done with a little python script. Also I want to add two buttons, where presets for the two setups get loaded. Button 1: kill the current source and start the darkice livestream. Button 2: kill the current source and start the playback of old recordings. Both options should have visual feedback for the operator. The raspberry has to work in headless mode without need for a VNC or SSH-connection for the normal usage..My problem: I tried: sudo killall darkice && /home/pi/darkice.sh.This code will get changed, because I probably have to use ices for the mp3-playback. So basically it kills darkice, starts the ices playback (for now only restarts the stream in a blink) and vice versa. The bash-file exists and gets executed at reboot via cronjob. That works well. When I execute the above mentioned killall command, icecast continues the broadcast almost instantly, but the stream stops on the clients. Everyone needs to restart it. Do I have an option to change the setup, so that I am able to switch between the two options without the need for everyone to restart? My plan was to create a bash-script, where I do this all inside and execute it via GPIO-input and pythoncode..Thanks in advance!",

I need to move the sliderTextInput, then the data loads on the map in the Browser..This is only an issue for Firefox, the other browsers (i.e. Chrome and IE) are fine and have the March data loaded and displayed on the map when the default 'Map' page loads..I have published my files up to GitHub - https://github.com/craycrayjodie/DataVis.Also, my app.R logic is as follows:.If a clever cookie can please advise on what changes I need to make to get the app working when the page loads with Firefox, that would be fabulous :)",

When the data is not adjusted, the colors on the map seem to correlate appropriately to the bin color categories, but when I adjust for population, the colors do not seem to update with the new bin color categories. They seem to correlate with the first bin color categories..For example, when I want to look at cumulative cases and cumulative deaths adjusted for population, the numbers are much smaller, but the new color palette is still associated with the original color palette (for non-adjusted metrics), so it looks like there's no data/extremely low counts..//Ignore the missing countries in the map//.I figure the issue lies somewhere with the pal3 and pal4 arguments not being recognized. Can someone explain why these arguments are being ignored? Or is it another issue that I'm missing?.Here is my code:...As you can see in the 2nd picture, the color for Brazil should be a dark orange.",

I could not find a way to retrieve the current value of slider from the plotly animation..The user will need to click the Play button to enable the dcc.Interval and the slider changes its value at intervals. When the value of slider changes, the graph will be updated accordingly..In the following codes, it put a lot of works rendering every frame because the ‘update_figure’ callback does a lot of works and return huge data to the dcc.Graph everytime when the value of slider changes..Is there any way to load all data into the graph at the start and just switch frames when the value of slider changes?.",

This is NOT what I want. I want this to happen automatically upon data-source selection..My Solution: to fire off a Notification to the container view once data is available so the container view can render the appropriate member view with the data..Problem: I'm using the publisher-subscribe scenario to wait for notification so I can display the data.\nBut I'm confused at handling the subscriber within the container view..I was thinking of using the **NSNotification** use of a handler @Objc function vs publish/subscribe.\nBut I'm mixing imperative with the subjective paradigm here..The following piece of code posts the notification upon receiving data:.The following code snippet is within a function of a View to handle the Notification.\nThis isn't firing..Question: should I pass a publisher variable between the class & the container view from which to launch the subscriber?.I understand the cause/affect of using @State <--> @Binding in synchronous time.\nBut I need the have the view react asynchronously upon the conclusion of acquiring the server data..I'm not sure I can use the conventional NSNotification within the container view..The bottom line: can I get the container view to react to the end of the network session?",

This becomes more important because, if I run the query at a county level (say, for 10 counties), then it models this 10 times, and would therefore take 10 times longer..As a shortcut, I can simply run 2 queries, with the output of the modelling query being added into a bigger R Markdown query (e.g., by saving/reading in an RDS file).

Then from the dashboard dropdown selection, choose the Rates per 100,000 population option. Under the Network tab, you should see a set-parameter-value request being made, which is the one I'm trying to reproduce..Below is a screenshot of the POST request successfully returning a JSON response in the Insomnia HTTP client. Note: The response is cut off, but I've verified that it is indeed a valid response...However, when I go to replicate this request in python, I get a non-JSON response that contains the datetime the request was made as well as some ID tuple. Here's an example of what that response looks like:..Regarding how I'm going about this problem, this is what my python code is looking like at the moment.

I pass the two values inside my state to another component PatientInfo along with the update state function:.PatientInfo.js simply passes the props down..PertinentMedications.js is where the user input will be collected:.My true question lies within the pertinentMedicationsChange function as Im not sure how to take the data im getting from the PertinentMedications component and format it to be placed in the state. First Im not sure if I can update the state the way im trying to with these two independent fields that send their data to this function to change the state? And If it is possible Im not sure how to properly setup the key value pairs when i call setState. Can anyone help?",

Obviously, it fits well to the second set of keywords..Exact matching words is one way to do it, but more complex situations might arise, for which it might make sense to use base forms of words (e.g. duck instead of ducks, or run instead of running) to enhance the algorithm. Now we're talking NLP already..I experimented with Spacy word and document embeddings (example) to determine similarity between a headline and each set of keywords.

This becomes more important because, if I run the query at a county level (say, for 10 counties), then it models this 10 times, and would therefore take 10 times longer..As a shortcut, I can simply run 2 queries, with the output of the modelling query being added into a bigger R Markdown query (e.g., by saving/reading in an RDS file).
